He has a 9.85 hectare estate of which 7.04 hectares are dedicated to coffee production. As well as this he also plants corn and beans but coffee is what he mainly grows to earn an income for his family. <br />Marlon José dreams of having his ideal farm. He’s been involved in farming work from a very early age along side his parents from whom with a lot of effort and dedication he learnt to work the land. <br />This year he’s asking for a loan to be invested in buying supplies such as calcium, boron and zinc so he can take care of his coffee crop. <br />This season he will employ 15 people from his community. This is the first loan he is arranging with PACSA.",
