In addition to this, Fred is involved in agriculture and through this, he has been able to supplement his income and provide food at home, so he is able to take care of his family. \r\n\r\nFred says he has acquired this loan facility to boost his milling machine business and produce business as he wants to buy another machine to help him expedite his work.\r\n\r\nFred also says that his biggest clientele base is local people who bring maize for milling. According to him, his biggest challenge is limited capital and weather changes such as droughts and floods. He is described as a hard working man who has been able to achieve everything by his own efforts. \r\n",
