                "description": "Richard, featured in the above picture, is representing his farming group formed by 13 farmers in Teso District, Kenya. He is 42 years old and a married father of eight children, and often described as a very reliable person. <br /><br />Although Richard has been a farmer for more than 20 years, he is new to One Acre Fund and decided to join this year because he really wanted to have access to quality training and acquire new farming methods. Even though he is new to the program, Richard wanted to represent his group because he wanted to help more farmers. With the profits earned from this season’s harvest, Richard hopes to be able to send his children to school.<br /><br />With this loan, the group will receive farming inputs to plant a total of 6.75 acres of land. They will also receive a total of 5 solar lights, as, even though Richard decided not to, some of the farmers in the group will be purchasing a solar light as part of their loan package.",
