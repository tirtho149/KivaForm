She is a farmer and has been working in this trade for more than 8 years.<br /><br />She has three hectares of rented land where she sows potatoes and onions. She earns a low income and lives poorly. She barely provides food and clothing for her family. She is running her farming with her sons. <br /><br />The planting season is coming up, but Khairiniso lacks funds to buy mineral fertilizer and seeds. She is asking for a loan for the fourth time from IMON International Bank for 15,000 TJS. She will use the loan to buy mineral fertilizer and onion seeds for her farming business, in order to get a good harvest and increase her income.<br /><br />Khairiniso awaits your support and help with thanks.",
