                "description": "Catherine's Group is formed by nine farmers in Kimilili District and is being represented by Catherine, who is the group leader pictured above. She is 43 years old and has 8 children. Catherine has been a farmer for more than 20 years and is often referred to as a very friendly person.<br /><br />Catherine isn’t new to One Acre Fund. She actually joined the program in 2013. Since then, she has noticed her life has changed, especially in the sense that she has been able to consistently feed her family. This year, Catherine will not only get fertilizer and maize seeds as part of her loan, but she will also purchase a solar light. She is very excited about this addition that will enable her to reduce the consumption of paraffin fuel and, therefore, save more money.<br /><br />Using this loan, Catherine's Group will purchase a total of 5 solar lights and use the farming inputs received to plant a total of 8.25 acres.",
