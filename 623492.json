Geghetsik's son is currently a labor migrant in Russia; he works there and sends some money to the family, helping them cover their daily needs. \r\n\r\nGeghetsik is engaged in breeding cows, piglets, and hens and cultivating corn, potato, grass, plum and apple. Her husband helps her in taking the agricultural products to the local market. Farming is a very important source of income for them. \r\n\r\nThe family's daily needs are increasing with time, and Geghetsik wants to enlarge her livestock holdings to be able to meet those needs. She is requesting a loan of USD 1500 to purchase three heifers. The loan will help her greatly to sustain the agribusiness. \r\n\r\nGeghetsik and her family will highly appreciate the goodwill of the lenders and will be thankful to them for the support. ",
