She has been running this business for 4 years. <br /><br />Touch has applied for a loan of 2,000,000 Cambodian riels (KHR) through Kiva's field partner, Chamroeun, to buy more fish and fish feed to support her farming business. Using the loan, she will be able to earn more income to continue her business as well as support her family's living standards. She hopes that she can grow her business and renovate her home. Her main challenge is more competitors.",
