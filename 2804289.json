                "description": "Charles is a farmer in Nyeri and has three cows. He lives with his family, and the money earned from the farm is the main source of income to support them.<br /><br />Charles is currently spending too much money on the propane required to power his home for cooking and hot water. His 16 cubic meter Sistema Biobolsa biodigester will allow him to use the abundant cows manure on-site to produce biogas to replace propane. The biodigester will transform the waste into two important resources: methane-rich, renewable biogas and potent biofertilizer.<br /><br />Not only will Charles use the biogas to cook and heat bathwater for his family, but he will also use the biofertilizer from the biodigester to increase his crops. With this biofertilizer, he will no longer have to resort to expensive, petroleum-based agrochemical fertilizers.<br /><br />This loan represents 100% of the total cost of the biodigester.\"",
