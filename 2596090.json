His wife, along with their three children, spend three to four hours a day on cooking and collecting fuels. His wife can not manage the household properly while spending this much time on these tasks. <br /><br />Md. Johirul hates to see his wife and children toil collecting cooking fuels and the smoke around the household that makes his family suffer from numerous health issues. He wants to buy a biodigester, as he finds it a cheaper source of renewable gas. He hopes his family will have more time together and to have a healthier environment in the household as there will be no more smoke coming from wood fuel.<br /><br />Md. Johirul is requesting a loan to buy a biodigester that will allow him to have this wonderful opportunity to develop the overall well being of his family.",
