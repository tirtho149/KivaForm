This man knows agriculture, he started a business with his brother, and with the profits he obtained he decided to work independently. Now, thanks to his good management, he has 1 hectare of onion cultivation and 1 hectare of mixed corn with beans. He wants to continue growing.<br /><br />José has approached the closest MiCrèdito office to request a KIVA loan with which he plans to buy minerals, foliage, urea, and organic fertiliser. With these products he will ensure that he has a good production. José wants to become a recognised micro-entrepreneur within the agricultural union.",
