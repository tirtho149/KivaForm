He works at selling organic fertilizers, including bone meal. He is also a peasant farmer growing crops. <br /><br />Ronaldo has known about Vahatra only for a short time. He is seeking a way to develop his business, which is very useful in the rural area where he lives. He is going to start taking out loans. His goal is to increase revenues to improve his family's living conditions. He also wants to achiever big plans in the future, first of all, building a house of his own. <br /><br />Ronaldo is asking lenders to help him to purchase 250 kg of livestock remains to process and resell. He stocks up from slaughterhouses or from aggregators. His hope is to have the support of lenders. He is going to optimize his savings through his profits.",
