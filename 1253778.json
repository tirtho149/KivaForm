She is 44 years old, is married and has four children. Florence has been a farmer for 17 years and is often referred to as a very hardworking individual.<br /><br />Florence isn’t new to One Acre Fund; she actually joined the program in 2015 and has since noticed her life has changed, especially in the sense that she has been able to consistently feed her family ever since. This year, Florence will not only get fertilizer and maize seeds as part of her loan, but will also purchase a solar light. She is very excited about this addition since now she will be able to have light during dark hours for her children to be able to study.<br /><br />Using this loan, Florence's group will purchase a total of three solar lights and use the farming inputs received to plant a total of 4.75 acres.",
