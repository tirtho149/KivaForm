Having been born in a humble family with little resources, he did not acquire education thus got involved in farming. <br /><br />Thanks to the lenders who funded his previous loan, Emmanuel managed to complete his house and the family's livelihood has greatly improved. <br /><br />Emmanuel has again approached UGAFODE for a loan of 1,200,000 UGX to buy fertilizers for his banana plantation so as to harvest quality output. He anticipates a good harvest that will attract buyers, thus earning income to support the family and also pay school fees for his children. <br /><br />Emmanuel is so hopeful that his standards of living will improve steadily, and that he can educate his children with this funding. He appreciates the continued support.",
