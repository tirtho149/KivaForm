He is looking forward to be working with One Acre Fund for the first time this year, as this means he will have access to quality training and acquire new farming methods. <br /><br />Joseph has been a farmer for more than 20 years and is often described as a very experienced one. He decided to represent his group because he likes being a leader. With the profits he earns from this coming season, Joseph would like to save some money for the future.<br /><br />Between the 11 farmers in Joseph’s Group, a total of 7 acres will be planted using the inputs from this loan.",
