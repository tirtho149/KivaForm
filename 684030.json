Daniel works in coca leaf agriculture, which is a job that leaves him very exhausted. Given the conditions of the climate, Daniel is susceptible to losing his harvest. Daniel is the only source of income for his household and needs this loan to buy a motorcycle that will allow him to transport himself to different markets to sell his product. ",
