                "description": "Jessey is 51 years old and has 4 children. He is a group leader and is representing his group formed by 5 farmers in Webuye District, Kenya. <br /><br />Jessey has been farming with One Acre Fund for years now, having joined the program for the first time in 2011. This decision was largely as a result of his desire to have access to quality training and acquire new farming methods and, although he described his last harvest as poor, he believes he could have a better one this year by continuing to work alongside One Acre Fund. Jessey also decided to purchase a solar light as part of his loan, which he is very excited about, as it will allow him to reduce the consumption of paraffin fuel and therefore save more money.<br /><br />Obtaining this loan means that Jessey's group will be able to receive a total of 3 solar lights, as well as farming inputs to plant a total of 3.25 acres.",
