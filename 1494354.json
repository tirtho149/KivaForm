He is a father to seven children and is known by his community as a very hardworking individual.<br /><br />Initially, Stephene joined One Acre Fund in 2011 because he wanted to have access to quality training and acquire new farming methods. Since he joined the program he says that his life has improved, especially because he has been able to consistently feed his family. With the profits from the coming harvesting season, Stephene plans to send his children to school.<br /><br />Between the 11 farmers in Stephene's Group, a total of 6.75 acres of land will be planted using the maize seeds and fertilizer received with the loan. Additionally, some of the farmers in the group will be purchasing a solar light, so with this loan, the group will also receive a total of nine solar lights.",
