Aleksan is a military man and he confessed his salary is not enough to meet his family's needs. Aleksan and his family members are engaged in farming. <br /><br />He has cows, calves, chickens and a lot of bee hives on his farm. Aleksan also has a plot of land where he cultivates vegetables. Alekasan sells vegetables, fruits, meat, eggs and honey from his farm at regional food markets. It is a good way to earn income. <br /><br />With the help of a former loan, Aleksan has a small greenhouse. He says that it was a great idea because it helps him cultivate vegetables during the cold season. So he has decided to build a second polyethylene greenhouse on his plot of land, which will help him to earn more profit.",
