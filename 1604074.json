They live in San Lucas in Sucre department, Bolivia.<br /><br />She and her husband live in their own house on their farming land which her husband built. The land is an inheritance from their parents as is the custom in this area. Evarista is an older woman who still perseveres in getting ahead. She works farming with her husband, six days a week. They grow peaches which they produce in season and sell at the local market. Their children went out on their own and have formed their own families. <br /><br />This is her 4th loan from the Fundacion Sartawi. She will use it to buy agricultural inputs like seed and organic manure to start planting.",
