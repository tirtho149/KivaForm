She joined One Acre Fund for the first time in 2010 and decided to represent her group because she wanted to spread the story of One Acre Fund farmers. <br /><br />With a portion of this loan, Florence will not only purchase maize seeds and fertilizer for the coming harvesting season, but also two solar lights. Receiving two solar lights as part of her loan means that now she will be able to have light during dark hours for her children to be able to study. Florence plans to use the profits she gains this year to buy more land to cultivate in.<br /><br />In total Florence’s Group will use the inputs received from this loan to plant a total of 12.5 acres of land. They will also receive a total of 11 solar lights.",
