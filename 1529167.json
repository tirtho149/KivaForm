He joined One Acre Fund for the first time in 2009 and decided to represent his group because he wanted to spread the story of One Acre Fund farmers. \n\nWith a portion of this loan, Bethany will not only purchase maize seeds and fertilizer for the coming harvesting season, but also a solar light. Receiving a solar light as part of his loan means that now he will be able to reduce the consumption of paraffin fuel and therefore save more money. Bethany plans to use the profits he gains this year to invest in a business.\n\nIn total Bethany’s Group will use the inputs received from this loan to plant a total of 11 acres of land. They will also receive a total of 15 solar lights.",
