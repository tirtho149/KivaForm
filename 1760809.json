                "description": "Sofia's Group is formed by 13 farmers in Mumias District and is being represented by Sofia, the group leader pictured above. She is 43 years old and has 6 children. Sofia has been a farmer for more than 20 years and is often referred to as a very reliable person.<br /><br />Sofia isn’t new to One Acre Fund. She actually joined the program in 2016 and has since noticed her life has changed, especially in the sense that she has been able to consistently feed her family ever since. This year, Sofia will not only get fertilizer and maize seeds as part of her loan, but will also purchase two solar lights. She is very excited about this addition, as now she will be able to have light during dark hours for her children to be able to study.<br /><br />Using this loan, Sofia's Group will purchase a total of 7 solar lights and use the farming inputs received to plant a total of 7.25 acres.",
