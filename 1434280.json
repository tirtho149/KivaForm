                "description": "Pictured above is Neddy, who, as a group leader, is representing her group formed of 9 farmers in Matete District, Kenya. She is a mother of 6 children and is known by her community as a very hardworking individual.<br /><br />Initially, Neddy joined One Acre Fund in 2010 because she wanted to earn enough to feed her family. Since she joined the program, she says that her life has improved, especially because she has been able to consistently feed her family. With the profits from the coming harvesting season, Neddy plans to save more money for the future.<br /><br />Between the 9 farmers in Neddy's Group, a total of 7.5 acres of land will be planted using the maize seeds and fertilizer received from the loan. Additionally, some of the farmers in the group will be purchasing a solar light so, with this loan, the group will also receive a total of 4 solar lights.",
