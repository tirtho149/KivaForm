                "description": "Sat, the farmer living in Kandal Stoeng district of Kandal province, is 36 years old. She is a married mother of two dependent children, one of whom is in school and the other one of whom is too young to attend school. \r\n\r\nIn order to support her living condition, Sat works a worker in one factory as the main source of income. She also grows paddy rice to earn supplemental income. She has been in this business for about 16 years, and the business has always before earned her good income.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, this year, she is not able to earn any good income as there is inadequate nutrient supply in her farmland. \r\n\r\nNow, she is applying for a loan, which is the first cycle for her, to save her business. She will use her loan to buy a motorcycle for daily commuter and business use, which she believes will decrease the cost of living. She hopes that it will be more convenient to travel from place to place; especially her children can go to school on it.",
