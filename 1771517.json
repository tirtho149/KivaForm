By nature she is ambitious and responsible. As an additional source of income for her family she has been working with livestock and agriculture since 1997. Thanks to Sayragul's hard work and the help of her son on the farm, her farm today has 6 cows, 30 sheep, 7 horses, and a land share of 2.0 hectares where she grows beans to sell and vegetables for her own use.<br /><br />In order to further develop her farm, Sayragul applied to the bank \"Bai-Tushum\" for a loan in the amount of 65,000 som (KGS) to pay for the spring field work and to buy fertilizers with the goal of getting a bigger harvest of organic beans. The proceeds from the loan will help Sayragul to improve her family's well-being.",
