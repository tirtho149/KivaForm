She joined One Acre Fund  in 2012 and decided to represent her group because she wanted to gain respect from her community. She is married and has three children.<br /><br />With a portion of this loan, Margat will not only purchase maize seeds and fertilizer for the coming harvesting season, but also a solar light. Receiving a solar light as part of her loan means that now she will be able to have light during the night and have somewhere to charge her phone. Margat plans to use the profits she gains this year to save more money for the future.<br /><br />In total Margat’s Group will use the inputs received from this loan to plant a total of 3.25 acres of land. They will also receive a total of three solar lights.",
