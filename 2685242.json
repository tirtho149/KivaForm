He is 39 years old, and married with two children, both of whom are still schooling.<br /><br />Dalius is a hard working gentleman who deals in banana production as his major and monthly source of income. He is thankful for the last funds he got from Kiva, which changed his financial status and his whole life at large.<br /><br />He is furthermore seeking a loan to buy manure and apply it to the soils in this rainy season, which will make the soils fertile to encourage healthy banana growth to sell. Thank you funders.",
