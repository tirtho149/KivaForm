He is 36 and lives with his family in Nablus, West Bank. <br /><br />He is working but his income is low and barely covers his family's basic needs. However, he turned to Palestine for Credit and Development (FATEN) to request a loan to buy a solar system to reduce the use of electricity and get hot water. This will enhance his family's living standards. <br /><br />He hopes you will help by funding his loan.",
