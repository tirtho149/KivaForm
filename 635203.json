He works about 9 hours each day and with the proceeds of his humble work he can get from day to day.\n\nJayro is grateful for the help the kiva lenders have provided. Thanks to this support, he could buy a motorbike to travel to work and can save on expenses for mobility, as he had to spend a lot of money to go to work.\n\nThis way he will be able to continue striving to realize his great dream: \"To have his own house.\"\n",
