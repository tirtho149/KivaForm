                "description": "Estrella is the president of the communal bank \"Por un Mejor Mañana,\" in Banco Mujer.  She is 48 years old, and she lives with her husband and their minor children, who attend elementary school.  She is a pig farmer who also cultivates vegetables for her family's consumption and to sell to neighbors.  She's been doing this work for 15 years, because this is a traditional activity that has been passed down through the years in this area.  Estrella has a farm where she has her pigs and her vegetable crops.  Her brother helps her as a farmhand; he is in charge of maintaining the farm.  With this loan, Estrella wants to buy more animals, seeds to plant, and herbicides to care for her crops.  This will enable her to support her household financially, because in this area there are no other sources of income.  Estrella chose Fundacion Mujer because of the good service and low interest rates they offer.",
