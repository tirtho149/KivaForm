She is 50 years old, married, and has 5 children.<br /><br />Leonida likes to think of herself as a very reliable person. She has been working alongside One Acre Fund since 2016 and decided to represent her group because she wanted to be more active in her community. She says that being part of the One Acre Fund community has meant that she has had more profits from each harvest. Leonida plans to use the profits from this coming season to buy a cow.<br /><br />In total, Leonida’s Group will receive inputs to cultivate 9.5 acres of land. Given that some members of the group will also be purchasing a solar light, this loan will also provide the group with a total of 4 solar lights.",
