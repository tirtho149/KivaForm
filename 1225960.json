He is 32 years old and, as a group leader, he is representing his group of 13 farmers in Teso District, Kenya.  He is married and has three children.<br /><br />Andrew is returning this season to work with One Acre Fund again as this means that he is able to earn enough to feed his family, which is why he decided to join in the first place. Andrew says that he is happy to have made that decision because, since he first joined in 2015, he has been able to consistently feed his family, which has improved his day-to-day life significantly. Andrew will use the profits from this season to send his children to school.<br /><br />The group will use this loan to purchase seeds and fertilizer to plant a total of 8.5 acres. Given that some members of the group will also be purchasing a solar light, with this loan, the group will also receive a total of nine solar lights.",
