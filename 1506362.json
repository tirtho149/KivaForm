                "description": "Melsi is a devoted husband and father to two children, who are 10 and 3 years old. He has been farming since he was a child and is now able to support his family with his farming business. He plants different vegetables, mainly potatoes, onions, and peppers, for which the city of Korca is very famous. He sells the vegetables early in the morning at the merchants of the market to earn income for his family. <br /><br />Melsi has planted 100 tree nuts, as seen behind him, and wants to take a loan from Kiva in order to plant the other part of that land with nuts also. He looks forward to using this loan to plant 100 nut trees to provide himself with a steady income in 10 to 20 years, when he will be older and won't have the physical power of today to work. <br /><br />Melsi is very grateful for the support of Kiva lenders and is sure he will be able to work hard and pay off his loan.",
