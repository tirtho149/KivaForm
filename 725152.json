                "description": "Nhung, 25, lives in a small new Thai traditional house with her husband and her 4-year-old child. They moved out of their parents' house 5 years ago and started an independent life, but they have plenty of difficulties.  They  lack capital. Currently, they earn an income cultivating rice, growing vegetables, and breeding poultry and pigs. They also have a grocery store for additional earnings. \r\n\r\nThis is the first loan Nhung has taken from the Anh Chi Em Program and she will use the loan to buy more chickens and ducks to expand her business. She heard about Anh Chi Em's services.  These services  include loans and training sessions about agriculture, business, and social issues.  These topics are of interest and use to her. She hopes that by joining in Anh Chi Em's activities, she can increase her income and also understand farming, breeding techniques, and gain other knowledge.\r\n\r\nNhung dreams that her child will have an excellent education which will result in a successful career.  She wants him to grow up, escape poverty, and have a better life.\r\n\r\nIn the picture, Nhung wears a Thai traditional costume with white shirt and stands first from the right.",
