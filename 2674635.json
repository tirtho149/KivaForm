                "description": "Meet Isidro!<br /><br />Isidro has dedicated to agriculture all his life. In the last couple of years, he started a small tilapia farm next to his house. With his own limited funds, he built two fish pools and the irrigation system for his microenterprise in San Jose de Veraguas, rural West Panama.<br /><br />Aquaculture is an environmentally responsible source of protein, helps to create healthier habitats, and is used to rebuild stocks of threatened or endangered species. By increasing production, Isidro can continue offering affordable protein to his community.<br /><br />Today, Isidro is applying for his first Kiva loan to expand his tilapia fish farm by buying alevins (fish at an early age) and fish feed to grow his production. <br /><br />Thank you for supporting farmers historically excluded from basic financial services.",
