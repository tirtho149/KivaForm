                "description": "Emmah is a farmer and has been practicing this for 12 years now. Despite her low education status, she has a voice and is respected in her home village. She has earned this through her sensible and hard work on her farm. Farming has been her only source of income. <br /><br />Emmah has a beautiful family to take care of, and this has been her greatest reason to endure and surpass every challenge that comes her way. She is determined to succeed.<br /><br />Emmah practices mixed farming and dairy farming. Her farm produces milk, eggs, tea and vegetables, which she sells locally. The income she gets from the farm is rewarding.<br /><br />Emmah, however, intends to expand her farming and increase her farm supplies. The income she is earning is not enough to enable her, so she is requesting a loan to purchase modern certified seeds, organic fertilizers and pesticides to use on her farm. She says the income from the farm will be used to repay the loan, pay school fees for her three children and also sustain her family.<br /><br />Being a faithful client to wonderful lenders such as Kiva through their partners Juhudi, Emmah did not hesitate but took a bold step knowing she will succeed.<br /><br />Kindly lend her!",
