She is 65 years old, married, and has six children.\r\n\r\nMary likes to think of herself as a very experienced farmer. She has been working alongside One Acre Fund since 2014 and decided to represent her group because she wanted to help more farmers. She says that being part of the One Acre Fund community has meant that she has learned a lot from farming trainings. Mary plans to use the profits from this coming season to invest in a business.\r\n\r\nIn total, Mary’s Group will receive inputs to cultivate 5.5 acres of land. Given that some members of the group will also be purchasing a solar light, with this loan, the group will also receive a total of five solar lights.",
