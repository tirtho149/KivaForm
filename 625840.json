                "description": "Ek is a 53-year-old married woman and mother of seven children. She lives with her family in her own home in Baray district, Kampong Thom province. Farming is a popular business in her area, and she has been engaged in this for more than 30 years now. She has around two hectares of farmland, on which she grows and harvests rice and cassavas to sell.\r\n\r\nEk would like to help her son, who is a motor taxi driver, to further improve his business by purchasing a trailer to attach with the motorcycle “Motor Remork in Khmer” to continually provide his service. Due to the lack of capital, she has applied for a loan in the sum of KHR 1,500,000 from HKL and Kiva lenders to buy a trailer for her son. This loan will enable her son to go ahead in his current business and boost more income to satisfy their basic living needs.",
