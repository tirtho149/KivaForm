She is the mother of 5 children and is known by her community as a very reliable person.<br /><br />Initially, Isabellah joined One Acre Fund in 2012 because she wanted to earn enough to feed her family. Since she joined the program, she says that her life has improved, especially because she has been able to save more money. With the profits from the coming harvest season, Isabellah plans to send her children to school.<br /><br />Among the 10 farmers in Isabellah's Group, a total of 6.75 acres of land will be planted using the maize seeds and fertilizer received with the loan.",
