What she loves most about it is when her produce does well and she makes good profits from it. This motivates her in her business, as it is the source of livelihood for her and her family. <br /><br />She is kindly requesting a loan that will enable her in irrigation and buying farm inputs that will boost her production. Her plan is to use her profits to pay back her loan as she continues meeting her family's needs. This loan will go a long way in raising her family’s living standards, as her dream is to see her children get a good education and for her and her family to live more comfortably in the future. She also aspires to become a large supplier of farm-fresh produce and create more employment than she has at the moment.",
