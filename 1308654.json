                "description": "Nazgul is 24 years old, married, and the mother of 2 preschool-aged children. Nazgul has a college education and has been working in agriculture for around 5 years. Thanks to Nazgul's hard work, she now has a fully developed farm. She has 1.5 hectares of land where she grows clover for sale. She also has 3 dairy cows, 20 sheep, and 2 horses. Nazgul has signed a contract to provide a local factory with organic milk for processing into dairy products. This allows her to continuously invest in her agricultural business. When she learned that she could obtain a loan from Bai Tushum Bank by borrowing against her future sales as part of the Chain of Value Added, Nazgul applied for a loan of 150,000 som (KGS) in order to buy purebred dairy cows and increase her volume of milk sales. Payment from the factory for the purchase of milk will be sent directly to Nazgul's bank account and her loan payment will be deducted automatically. She plans to invest the revenue from the loan into the further growth of her business.",
