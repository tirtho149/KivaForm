Ghulzhamal has a secondary education and works in a school as an English teacher.  At the moment, though, she is on maternity leave.  <br /><br />Ghulzhamal is involved in animal husbandry and agriculture.  She has two cows, and she also grows potatoes and clover for resale on one hectare of land.  She makes about 29,000 som (KGS) per month, which helps her cover food expenses and the daily needs of her family.  In order to further develop her business, she has turned to Bai Tushum and requested a loan of 75,000 som (KGS) to buy two cows and increase her cattle headcount.  She is planning to use the earnings from her loan to further grow her business, which will eventually allow her to renovate her house.",
