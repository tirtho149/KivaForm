                "description": "Joy is 25 years old and has four children. She is a group leader, and is representing her group formed by eight farmers in Chwele district, Kenya. <br /><br />Joy has been farming with One Acre Fund for years now, having joined the program for the first time in 2007. This decision was largely a result of her desire to have access to quality training and acquire new farming methods and, although she described her last harvest as good, she believes she could have a better one this year by continuing to work alongside One Acre Fund. <br /><br />Joy also decided to purchase two solar lights as part of her loan, which she is very excited about, as it will allow her to reduce the consumption of paraffin fuel and therefore save more money.<br /><br />Obtaining this loan means that Joy's Group will be able to receive a total of six solar lights, as well as farming inputs to plant a total of 4.25 acres.",
