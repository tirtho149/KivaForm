                "description": "Janpher’s life is full of struggles. She is a mother of eight children who lives in Kitale, and has been working on her farm for ten years. Through farming, she is able to meet the basic needs of her large family. She has also been able to provide a solid foundation for her children's education.<br /><br />In Kenya, the agricultural field is one of the most competitive industries, especially due to the high costs of operations necessary to improve farming yield. Such costs,  including the cost of land acquisition and inputs, have always been high. To meet the high costs of inputs, farmers have been forced to borrow from financial institutions which sometimes impose very complicated procedures in loan distribution. Some farmers, especially women, end up being disadvantaged.<br /><br />Janepher is requesting a loan to buy farm fertilizers to improve her crop farming. Her loan will enable her to improve her production through the use of quality fertilizers and certified seeds. <br /><br />To others, this might just be a mere loan. But to Janepher, this is the biggest opportunity she will have this season to change her life. Kindly lend to Janepher today, and help brighten up her life in this last phase of 2021.",
