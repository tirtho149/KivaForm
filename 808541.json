She was able to raise more and was financially prepared for the next cropping season. \r\n\r\nCirila requested another loan, which she will use to purchase organic fertilizer to restore nutrients to have a productive harvest. With this loan, the entire farm will be fertilized for a productive farm in the future.\r\n",
