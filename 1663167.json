He joined One Acre Fund for the first time in 2013 and decided to represent his group because he wanted to gain leadership skills. <br /><br />With a portion of this loan, Collins will not only purchase maize seeds and fertilizer for the coming harvesting season, but also a solar light. Receiving a solar light as part of his loan means that now he will be able to have light during the night and have somewhere to charge his phone. <br /><br />Collins plans to use the profits he gains this year to buy a cow.<br /><br />In total Collins Group will use the inputs received from this loan to plant 1.75 acres of land. They will also receive a total of nine solar lights.",
