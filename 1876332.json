Although he is the only person featured in the above picture, he is representing his group of 4 farmers in Wanging ombe District, Tanzania.<br /><br />Shem is often described by his community as a very experienced farmer and decided to be the one to represent his group because he likes being a leader. Like many of his fellow farmers, Shem decided he wanted to be part of the One Acre Fund community in order to get the best quality fertilizer and hybrid seeds and hopes to use the profits from this year’s harvest to repair his home.<br /><br />This loan will not only help Shem but the whole group, who will receive maize seeds and fertilizer to plant a total of 5 acres of land.",
