She started in 2010 with the hope of supporting her husband with the family expenses, and she is happy that it is paying off. She also has a piggery project that brings in extra income.<br /><br />In a bid to improve the quality and quantity of her farm yields, Naume has applied for a loan of UGX 2,000,000 from UGAFODE to buy organic fertilizer. She is optimistic that her income will increase because good yields attract competitive prices. Naume appreciates the funders for the financial support that will improve her farming.<br /><br />The gentleman in the photograph is one of the UGAFODE's credit staff.",
