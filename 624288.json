He is a rice farmer on land that he leased from others. \r\n\r\nIn order to take good care of his family, he needed to earn more income; that’s why he increased his rice areas with the support of Seva MFI. He has already repaid the money he borrowed from Seva MFI. \r\n\r\nSatiesh recently inherited a residential plot from his grandfather and wants to build a house on it through the profits from his rice production. He asked Seva MFI to support his rice production and applied for a loan of SRD 8,000 to purchase fertilizers and pesticides.\r\n",
