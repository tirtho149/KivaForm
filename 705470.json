                "description": "Jeaneth is a woman who is very dedicated to her family and she is also a farmer and businesswoman. This job generates the income to cover the various household expenses. She is married and has four children; her oldest daughter is married, the second is her son who helps her out with her business, the third is her daughter in high school, and the last is her son who is in elementary school. All her children live in her home, including her son-in-law.\n\nLooking for a way out of their financial problems and trying to get ahead, her and her husband have been working for 10 years planting and growing coffee beans, since this product is sought after by residents and sells out in the area. The warm climate, fertile land and, at the same time, the care that her and her husband give are the main reasons for the success of their business. Their coffee crops are located approximately 15 kilometers from their home. Once it is time to cut and gather the coffee beans, the whole family is involved, but Jeaneth is the one who is in charge of selling the beans afterwards. She works very hard every day for her business and especially for her family.\n\nShe is asking for support from Kiva investors to pay for the hospital costs and the different medical treatments needed by a family member. Her biggest wish is that her family member recovers because the family member is a young person with their whole life ahead of them.",
