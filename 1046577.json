They started their farm 10 years ago and Seyran joined the family business a year ago. In the beginning it was very difficult, because they needed to invest a lot of working capital. With much effort and the help of his old parents, he was able to move forward and today has a one of the best land. His vegetables are very good quality, which he says is due to the constant irrigation they receive, since the business has a complete underground irrigation system.  Now his monthly income makes 250 AZN. \n\nThey sell their products in the fruit and vegetable market of the city. Seyran requests a loan of 1200 AZN for the purchase of fertilizer and seeds. This will allow him to better provide for his family.",
