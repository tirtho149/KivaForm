Cayalti is located in the province of Chiclayo which is part of the Lambayeque region on the north coast of Peru.\n\nKarina rents her moto taxi out for urban transport and a third of the earnings are made from the rental. In addition to this she also grows and sells maize and raises and sells barnyard animals, which she has done for some years now. She raises her animals in the back of her home. \n\nKarina has applied for a loan of 1500 nuevos soles from Edpyme Alternativa to buy a better variety and quantity of animals such as guinea pigs, ducks and hens which will allow her to sell them at a higher price. By doing so she will be able to garner more customers, generate a greater income and improve the quality of life for her family.\n",
