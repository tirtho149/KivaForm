In his community, farming is the primary occupation and, like many industrious smallholders, he dreams of expanding his farm business.<br /><br />Sani is returning to work with Babban Gona this season as he will get access to better-yielding seeds, fertilizers and other essential farm inputs that will boost his yield. In addition to increasing Sani’s yield to ensure that his family never goes hungry, this loan will also help him earn up to three times his net income from selling his maize. Since he first joined Babban Gona in 2017, his happiest memory was buying more farmland.<br /><br />With lenders’ support to grow his farming business, Sani is looking forward to an abundant harvest. He plans to use the profits from this season’s harvest to pay his children's school fees.",
