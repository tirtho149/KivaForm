                "description": "Hiyatun is a 44-year-old married woman living in Murshidabad, West Bengal. She is engaged in animal husbandry to support her family of five. She sells cow milk and other dairy products in the local market. Sometimes she also sells byproducts such as cow dung. Cow dung is used as farm manure and cow dung cake is used as fuel in rural areas. The family manages to earn a monthly household income of INR 10,000 through their business. <br /><br />The business is doing well and she plans to expand. In fact, she has observed a rise in demand for the cow milk she supplies. She now wants to purchase another cow. However, she doesn't have sufficient savings to do so. <br /><br />She has applied for a loan of INR 20,000 from BJS, one of Milaap's field partners. She will use the amount to purchase a new cow and fodder so she can expand her business of selling milk and byproducts. <br /><br />She and her family are grateful to the lender for the support.",
