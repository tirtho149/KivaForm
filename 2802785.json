He has been involved in coffee production for the past 30 years. His profits have allowed him to build a home for his family and provide for his children's education. <br /><br />However, his farm is challenged by low yields due to soil erosion and loss of soil fertility. He is seeking funds to purchase manure, mulch, and fertilizer to improve his harvest. Additionally, Francis plans to invest in a coffee-drying machine so he can increase his income by selling dried coffee. <br /><br />Thank you, funders!",
