                "description": "Biebieta, featured in the above picture, is representing her farming group formed by 10 farmers in Kakamega North District, Kenya. She is 42 years old and a married mother of five children; she is often described as a very hardworking individual. \r\n\r\nAlthough Biebieta has been a farmer for 20 years, she is new to One Acre Fund and decided to join this year because she really wanted to have access to quality training and acquire new farming methods. Even though she is new to the program, Biebieta wanted to represent her group because she wanted to be more active in her community. With the profits earned from this season’s harvest, Biebieta hopes to be able to send her children to school.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, the group will receive farming inputs to plant a total of 5.75 acres of land. They will also receive a total of four solar lights, as, even though Biebieta decided not to, some of the farmers in the group will be purchasing a solar light as part of their loan package.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n",
