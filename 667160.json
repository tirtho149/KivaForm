She is married and mother to one son and three daughters. Her husband works as an employee in a local firm where he earns a low income, so for the past 3 years, he has also worked as a farmer on his land. This land is providing a good farming project but it needs a lot of improvement.\r\n\r\nThaera is taking a loan of 2,000 USD from FATEN. This loan will help her husband buy some farming tools. By taking this loan, Thaera's husband will be able to develop his project and increase his productivity, to grow the family's income.",
