She keeps dairy cows and grows crops both for sale and for consumption. She sells her farm produce both at the local market and to companies.<br /><br />The biggest growth constraint for Alice is lack of access to capital to buy agricultural inputs necessary to increase her farm’s productivity. She lives in a part of Kenya where there are no banks. She is seeking a loan to buy improved seeds, fertilizers and other important inputs that control weeds and pests.<br /><br />With your lending, Alice will be able to access capital to buy important farm inputs that will increase her farm’s productivity and family income.",
