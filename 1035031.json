She is 27 years old and, as a group leader, she is representing her group of 7 farmers in Webuye District, Kenya.  She is married and has 2 children.<br /><br />Regineta is returning this season to work with One Acre Fund again as this means that she is able to earn enough to feed her family, which is why she decided to join in the first place. Regineta says that she is happy to have made that decision because, since she first joined in 2015, she has had more profits from each harvest, which has improved her day-to-day life significantly. Regineta will use the profits from this season to send her children to school.<br /><br />The group will use this loan to purchase seeds and fertilizer to plant a total of 4.5 acres. Given that some members of the group will also be purchasing a solar light, with this loan, the group will also receive a total of 2 solar lights.",
