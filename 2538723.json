She is buying a Sistema Biobolsa biodigester to reduce the costs of her business and to improve crop yields in order to save money for her family.<br /><br />Teresiah finds herself spending a lot of money on non-renewable LP gas due to the heat required in the milk production process. By using the biogas generated by her 20 cubic meters Sistema Biobolsa biodigester, she will decrease both her costs and her carbon footprint. The same cow manure used to produce the biogas, will also produce a potent biofertilizer to use on her vegetable crops.<br /><br />This loan represents 100% of the price of the biodigester.",
