Even though Christopher is the only one featured in the above picture, he is actually representing his group formed by 8 farmers in Chwele District, Kenya.\n\nChristopher started working alongside One Acre Fund a few years ago, in 2008, and decided to do so because he wanted to get the best quality fertilizer and hybrid seeds. Since then, he has seen his life improve; especially in the sense that he has been able to consistently feed his family ever since. This year he decided to represent his group because he wanted to help more farmers.\n\nChristopher’s Group will receive farming inputs to plant a total of 4.5 acres of land. Additionally, one farmer in the group will be purchasing a solar light so, with this loan, the group will also receive 1 solar light.\"",
