                "description": "Pictured above is David, who, as a group leader, is representing his group formed of 13 farmers in Sirisia District, Kenya. He is married and is a father to 2 children, known by his community as a very trustworthy person. <br /><br />Initially, David joined One Acre Fund in 2009 because he wanted to have access to quality training and acquire new farming methods. Since he joined the program, he says that his life has improved, especially because he has been able to consistently feed his family. With the profits from the coming harvesting season, David plans to send his children to school.<br /><br />Between the 13 farmers in David's group, a total of 6 acres of land will be planted using the maize seeds and fertilizer received with the loan. Additionally, some of the farmers in the group will be purchasing a solar light so, with this loan, the group will also receive a total of 3 solar lights.",
