The raw milk from the cows he sells to a nearby organic dairy farm that works only with milk from cows untreated with medicine. The yogurt made in this farm is 100% bio and made in a very primitive way. In addition to caring for the livestock, Pushkin plants fodder for his cows in the agricultural land that he owns.<br /><br />Pushkin is a 41-year-old, married father of three. His oldest child is 11 years old, and the youngest one is 1 year old.<br /><br />Pushkin’s livestock is the only source of income for the entire family. Knowing how responsible he is, he promises that he will pay back the loan like the previous one he had with the VFA.",
