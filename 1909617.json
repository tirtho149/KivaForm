As a group leader, he is representing 8 farmers in Mumias District, Kenya. <br /><br />Francis is returning this season to work with One Acre Fund because this means that he is able to access quality training and acquire new farming methods, which is why he decided to join in the first place. Francis says that he is happy to have made that decision because, since he first joined in 2017, he has been able to consistently feed his family, which has improved his day-to-day life significantly. Francis will use the profits from this season to buy a cow.<br /><br />The group will use this loan to purchase seeds and fertilizer to plant 7 acres.",
