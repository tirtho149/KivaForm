Although he is the only person featured in the above picture, he is actually representing his group of seven farmers in Iringa District, Tanzania.<br /><br />Exaud is often described by his community as a very friendly  person and decided to be the one to represent his group because he wanted  to  spread the story of One  Acre  Fund  farmers. Like many of his fellow farmers, Exaud decided he wanted to be part of the One Acre Fund community in order to have  access to the  best seed prices.  He hopes to use the profits from this year’s harvest to repair his home.<br /><br />This loan will help not only Exaud, but the whole group, who will receive maize seeds and fertilizer to plant a total of 6.5 acres of land.",
