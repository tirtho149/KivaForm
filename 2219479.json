                "description": "Fiji fell to the onslaught brought about by the most intense coronavirus (COVID-19). Just before this happened, it went through one of the most devastating cyclones, tropical cyclone Winston, that was a nightmare to many Fijians. With the adversities of these events, there was much damage done to crops and businesses. Lives were shuttered. <br /><br />However, many women entrepreneurs in Fiji are like Maureen. She has struggled through the twin effects of COVID-19 and natural disasters, and continues to hope. Fijians are admired for their resiliency and hope for a better tomorrow and mother nature’s healing balm, similar to the comfort for a child after being disciplined. <br /><br />Maureen works as a beekeeper. She is requesting a loan to buy more hives, a bee suit, gloves and boots, a hive tool, smoker, bee brush, queen catcher, feeder and capping scratcher.  She will use her loan to revive her beekeeping business and ensure that it keeps her family afloat during these trying times. Maureen's hope for better days makes her struggle worthwhile and just as sweet as honey.",
