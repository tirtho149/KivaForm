He tries so hard to help them in living expenses.<br /><br />Basel recently opened a small restaurant for falafel and chickpeas in the camp where he lives. It's a good business there because there's no other restaurant near him. He went to Palestine for Credit and Development FATEN to request a US dollar loan to buy food materials and some of the tools he needs in his work. He hopes you will help and fund his loan.",
