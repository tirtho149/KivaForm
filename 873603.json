Charles is representing his group of 14 farmers in Matete District and is happy to be working with One Acre Fund for the first time this year.\r\n\r\nCharles has been a farmer for more than 30 years and, in order to get the best quality fertilizer and hybrid seeds, he decided to join the One Acre Fund program this season. His loan will not only include farming inputs but also a solar light, which he is very happy to be getting as that means he will now have light during dark hours for his children to be able to study. With the profits from this coming season, Charles is planning to send his children to school.\r\n\r\nA total of 10.25 acres will be planted by Charles's Group, and between them they will receive a total of 11 solar lights.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n",
