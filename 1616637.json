As a group leader, he is representing his group in Kilolo South District, formed by 13 farmers, including himself.<br /><br />Chesco has been a farmer for 20 years, and has worked with One Acre Fund for a while now, having joined for the first time in 2015 because he wanted to get the best quality fertilizer and hybrid seeds. Not only will he get maize seeds and fertilizer with his loan, but also a solar light in order to have light during the night and have somewhere to charge his phone. He decided that he will use the profits he gains from this year’s harvest to invest in a business.<br /><br />With this loan, Chesco’s Group will receive a total of 7 solar lights as well as farming inputs to plant a total of 10.5 acres.",
