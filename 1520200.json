As a group leader, he is representing eight farmers in Webuye District, Kenya. <br /><br />Eliakimu is returning this season to work with One Acre Fund so he would be able to earn enough to feed his family, which is why he decided to join in the first place. Eliakimu says that he is happy to have made that decision because, since he joined in 2014, he has been able to consistently feed his family. He has improved his day-to-day life significantly. Eliakimu will use the profits from this season to send his children to school.<br /><br />The group will use this loan to purchase seed and fertilizer to plant a total of 2 acres. Given that some members of the group will also be purchasing a solar light, with this loan, the group will also receive a total of seven solar lights.",
