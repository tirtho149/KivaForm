Now we are moving into programs for the Veteran and civilian community that being in a rural area affords us.  We are constructing a large greenhouse which we will use as a teaching took, and for food sales to local farmer's markets and in Community Supported Agriculture.  In addition to these activities, we will implement the Silvy the Food Desert Camel program for training the community.  Your help with this loan assists this program.",
