                "description": "Biliah is 49 years old and has five children. She is a group leader and is representing her group formed by 10 farmers in Chwele District, Kenya. <br /><br />Biliah has been farming with One Acre Fund for years now, having joined the program for the first time in 2011. This decision was largely as a result of her desire to have access to quality training and acquire new farming methods and, although she described her last harvest as very good, she believes she could have a better one this year by continuing to work alongside One Acre Fund. As part of her loan, Biliah also decided to purchase a solar light, which she is very excited about, as it will allow her to have light during dark hours for her children to be able to study.<br /><br />Obtaining this loan means that Biliah's Group will be able to receive a total of seven solar lights, as well as farming inputs to plant a total of four acres.",
