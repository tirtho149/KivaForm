As a group leader, she is representing 13 farmers from Alego District, Kenya.<br /><br />Peres is returning this season to work with One Acre Fund again, as this means that she is able to get the best quality fertilizer and hybrid seeds, which is why she decided to join in the first place.  She says that she is happy to have made that decision because, since she first joined in 2016, she has been able to consistently feed her family, which has improved her day-to-day life significantly.  Peres will use the profits from this season to buy a cow.<br /><br />The group will use this loan to purchase seeds and fertilizer to plant a total of 12 acres.  Given that some members of the group will also be purchasing a solar light, the group will receive a total of four solar lights with this loan.",
