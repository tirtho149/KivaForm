Tropical Cyclone Yasa hit the northern islands of Fiji in December 2020 when the Fijian economy was just bouncing back from a recession.<br /><br />Terengauea hopes to invest in farming as a business.  A loan would allow her to buy essential items such as seeds, manure, a wheelbarrow, farming tools, and protective clothing (boots and gloves), as well as pay for laborers.  She also hopes to repair the damage to her home so that her family can live in comfort.<br /><br />Terengauea is confident in her skills and hopes to provide employment to the youths in her village.",
