                "description": "Stella is a 27-year-old self-employed small-scale entrepreneur. She is based in Kabwe district in the Central Province of Zambia.<br /><br />Stella has been running a bar since 2016. The bar is her only source of income. Stella stocks a range of alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks including lager, wine, whiskey, and a selection of fruit juices. Stella often runs out of stock and is forced to close her bar early. She now wishes to increase her stock to enable her to cater to all her customers without abruptly running out of stock.<br /><br />To achieve this, Stella needs an additional fridge to increase her cold storage capacity to chill her drinks before serving them to her customers. An increase in stock will mean increased sales and, consequently, increased revenue for Stella.<br /><br />Rent-To-Own is keen on helping small-scale entrepreneurs like Stella to grow their businesses. Rent-To-Own will deliver the fridge to Stella's bar and train her on how to use and maintain it properly so that it may continue to work for her for a long time to come.",
