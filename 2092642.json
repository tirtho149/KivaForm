She has 10 cows, 30 sheep and 2 horses. She keeps cattle in a barn in winter and drives them to the mountains in summer. She also sells organic milk and grows organic vegetables like tomatoes, cucumbers, and potatoes. In order to continue developing her farm, she has applied for a loan with Bai-Tushum Bank for 180,000 som (KGS) to lease land for planting organic vegetables. She plans to invest the income from the loan to further develop her farm.",
