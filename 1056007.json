(She's the first on the left in the photo.)<br /><br />With a desire to generate an income for herself and bring up her family, María makes a living raising animals and selling traditional skirts. She has been running these businesses for 6 years and in spite of her advanced age she works really hard every day.<br /><br />She is a woman with natural leadership and this is why she is the representative for the group known as Las Conocidas 1 y 2. Together with this group she is asking for a loan, which she will use to buy chickens to raise and traditional skirts for her two businesses. Her biggest dream is to improve the living conditions for her much-loved family.",
