His mother and married brother and his family live with Mirian as well. \r\n\r\nMirian runs small-scale agricultural land and has a citrus garden. He sells citrus in the wintertime and earns seasonal income. The family also has one milk cow and sells cheese at the local market. \r\n\r\nMirian managed to save and has recently bought an apartment in the neighboring town. Now he is requesting a loan to purchase furniture and furnish the flat comfortably. Mirian plans to rent it out at a good price and get a monthly income. This initiative will increase his family's funds and Mirian will be able to improve the standard of living for his family members. He hopes for your generosity. \r\n",
