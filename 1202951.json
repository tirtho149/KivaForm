                "description": "Santa Cruz El Quiché is known as the cradle of the Maya Quiché culture and is located in the Western Highlands of Guatemala. Here, 8 Maya K’iche ladies, members of the Friendship Bridge Trust Bank “Monja Blanca Sacapulas,” are excited to begin their 1st loan cycle with Kiva.<br /><br />The “Microcredit Plus” program of Friendship Bridge (loans + education) is giving them the tools they need to empower themselves, educate their children and eliminate poverty. These 8 ladies have businesses that range from agriculture (onions and tomatoes) to traditional textile fabrication (ornate blouses or “huipiles”). <br /><br />Catarina is a member of the group who is  29 years old and the mother of 3 children who range in age from 5-11. Although she only has a 3rd grade education, she is keenly aware of its value and has set a goal that her children at least reach high school and be better prepared for a successful future. Catarina has a small farm and fabricates traditional textiles. She is requesting a loan to buy lots of thread for her traditional textile business, as well as tools and fertilizer for her crops (onions and tomatoes). <br /><br />The monthly educational trainings are of great benefit to the women. They learn about themselves (self-esteem, women’s rights, and sexual and reproductive health), their families (hygiene and nutrition) and their businesses (planning and investing).<br /><br />Thank you, Kiva investors, for your kindness and generosity in funding these much-needed loans!",
