As a group leader, she is representing her group of 15 farmers in Mumias District, Kenya. <br /><br />Loice is returning this season to work with One Acre Fund again as this means that she will be able to get the best-quality fertilizers and hybrid seeds, which is why she decided to join in the first place. Loice says that she is happy to have made that decision because, since she first joined in 2017, she has been able to consistently feed her family, which has improved her day-to-day life significantly. Loice will use the profits from this season to send her children to school.<br /><br />The group will use this loan to purchase seeds and fertilizer to plant a total of 6.25 acres. Given that some members of the group will also be purchasing solar lights, the group will also receive a total of four solar lights with this loan.",
