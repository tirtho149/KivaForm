She is a mother of six children and is known by her community as a very experienced farmer.<br /><br />Initially, Agnes joined One Acre Fund in 2012, because she wanted to have access to quality training and acquire new farming skills. Since she joined the program, she says that her life has improved, especially because she has been able to consistently feed her family. With the profits from the coming harvest season, Agnes plans to send her children to school.<br /><br />Among the 11 farmers in Agnes's Group, a total of 6.5 acres of land will be planted using the maize seeds and fertilizer received with the loan. Additionally, some of the farmers in the group will be purchasing solar lights, so the group will receive five solar lights.",
