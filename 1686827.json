They are living together at their home that they own.<br /><br />Salome is one of SPBD's successful women. This is her 10th loan cycle. She has two businesses — tapa making and a plantation. She makes tapa cloth at her home by herself, and her daughter helps her operate the plantation. She earns income by selling her harvest from the plantation and selling her tapa cloths.<br /><br />Salome said Cyclone Gita, which struck Tonga in February 2018, destroyed half of the roof of their house as well as the kitchen, and caused damages to her inventory of finished products that were ready to sell.<br /><br />She has a vision for the future to earn more income for her house renovation, and also to save enough to buy a new car that would be used for her business and family transportation needs.",
