As a group leader, she is representing her group of seven farmers in Webuye District, Kenya. <br /><br />Annety is returning this season to work with One Acre Fund again as this means that she is able to earn enough to feed her family, which is why she decided to join in the first place.<br /><br />Annety says that she is happy to have made that decision because, since she first joined in 2016, she has been able to consistently feed her family, which has improved her day-to-day life significantly.<br /><br />Annety will use the profits from this season to send her children to school.<br /><br />The group will use this loan to purchase seeds and fertilizer to plant a total of 2.25 acres. Given that some members of the group will also be purchasing solar lights, with this loan, the group will also receive a total of four solar lights.",
