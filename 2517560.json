Animal milk is processed and delivered to consumers organically without chemical additives in a traditional way. Dairy products contain a lot of beneficial bacteria and nutrients, which are very good for the human body, so Altantsetseg is working to spread this information to people and bring her products to more people. She sells new products every day. Her products are in high demand with an average of 40 to 50 people per day. In addition to expanding her business and having her shop, Altantsetseg is also working to introduce national products to the region and foreign tourists.<br /><br />She will use this loan to open her shop. By having an Altantsetseg boutique store counter, she will not only increase her profits but will also be able to deliver her brand of organic products to more people.",
