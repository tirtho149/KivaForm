They have a plot of agricultural land, where they grow nut and mandarin trees. They work hard and sell the harvest locally. \r\n\r\nRusudan wishes to open a small market and needs money to purchase products. The 'Start Up' program, which is a joint initiative with Kiva and Credo, enables her to get a loan of 2,000 GEL. With the received credit she will purchase an inventory of products and open a market. This will give her a chance to generate a more stable income and improve the living conditions for her family. \r\n\r\nRusudan awaits your support.",
