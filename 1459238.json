She joined One Acre Fund for the first time in 2009 and decided to represent her group because she wanted to help more farmers. <br /><br />With a portion of this loan, Everlyne will not only purchase maize seeds and fertilizer for the coming harvesting season, but also a solar light. Receiving a solar light as part of her loan means that now she will be able to have an overall improved quality of life. Everlyne plans to use the profits she gains this year to send her children to school.<br /><br />In total, Everlyne’s Group will use the inputs received from this loan to plant 5.5 acres of land. They will also receive a total of 12 solar lights.",
