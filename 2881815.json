They live in the canton of Rocafuerte, an agricultural town of hard-working people who make a living working in the fields and raising livestock.<br /><br />He is an industrious man who looks for ways to earn the necessary resources to support his family. For them, life in the countryside is difficult because they do not have basic services such as education, health, and other. Despite these difficulties, he tries to give them what they need.<br /><br />He has a farm where he grows coconuts. From time to time, he collects the production and sells it at the wholesale market. To have a good harvest he uses natural irrigation systems, as well as organic fertilizers and insecticides, to protect the environment as well.<br /><br />This loan is to buy organic fertilizer and insecticide to improve production.",
