He is a father to 8 children and is known by his community as a very trustworthy person.\n\nInitially, Philip joined One Acre Fund in 2011 because he wanted to get the best quality fertilizer and hybrid seeds. Since he joined the program he says that his life has improved, especially because he has been able to consistently feed his family. With the profits from the coming harvesting season, Philip plans to send his children to school.\n\nBetween the 10 farmers in Philip's Group, a total of 5.25 acres of land will be planted using the maize seeds and fertilizer received with the loan. Additionally, some of the farmers in the group will be purchasing a solar light so, with this loan, the group will also receive a total of 3 solar lights.",
