Since joining One Acre Fund in 2015, Nancy has noticed that she has learned a lot from farming training sessions.<br /><br />Nancy described her harvest as good last year, but believes she can have a better one this year by continuing to work with One Acre Fund. She is very excited to also be purchasing a solar light, in addition to fertilizer and maize, because she will now be able to have an overall improved quality of life. With the profits from this season’s harvest, she plans to send her children to school.<br /><br />With this loan, Nancy’s Group will be able to plant 5.5 acres of land and purchase 3 solar lights.",
