As a group leader, she is representing her group of 10 farmers in Alego District, Kenya. <br /><br />Annah is returning this season to work with One Acre Fund again as this means that she is able to earn enough to feed her family, which is why she decided to join in the first place. Annah says that she is happy to have made that decision because, since she first joined in 2017, she has been able to consistently feed her family. This has improved her day-to-day life significantly. Annah will use the profits from this season to send her children to school.<br /><br />The group will use this loan to purchase seeds and fertilizer to plant a total of 4.25 acres.",
