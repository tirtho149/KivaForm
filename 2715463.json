She lives with her mother and sister, and she also has relatives living abroad.   <br /><br />Leydi has had a business selling vegetables for seven years, and also works in beekeeping, a trade that she learned with her family. She does beekeeping work from 5:00 a.m. to 6:30 a.m. and from 3:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m., while from 7:00 a.m. to 11:00 a.m., she sells fruits and vegetables. <br /><br />She is requesting a loan to obtain more financial resources to buy supplies for one of her businesses. She will invest the money in the purchase of a full suit, a bee smoker, and other supplies for beekeeping. She hopes the investment will allow her to get more production from the hive to increase her sales and profits. <br /><br />Her dream is to grow her businesses and have economic stability to meet her obligations.",
