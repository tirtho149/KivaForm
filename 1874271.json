As a group leader, she is representing her group of three farmers in Wanging'ombe District, Tanzania. <br /><br />Tumpe is returning this season to work with One Acre Fund again as this means that she is able to get the best quality fertilizer and hybrid seeds, which is why she decided to join in the first place. Tumpe says that she is happy to have made that decision because, since she first joined in 2017, she has had a healthier life due to better nutrition, which has improved her day-to-day life significantly. Tumpe will use the profits from this season to send her children to school.<br /><br />The group will use this loan to purchase seeds and fertilizer to plant a total of eight acres.",
