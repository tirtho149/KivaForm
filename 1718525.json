She is 25 years old, married and has 4 children.<br /><br />Robai likes to think of herself as a very experienced farmer. She has been working alongside One Acre Fund since 2017 and decided to represent her group, because she likes being a leader. She says that being part of the One Acre Fund community has meant that she has been able to consistently feed her family. Robai plans to use the profits from this coming season to save more money for the future.<br /><br />In total, Robai’s Group will receive inputs to cultivate 4.5 acres of land. Some members of the group will also be purchasing a solar light with this loan, for a total of 5 solar lights.",
