He is a farmer and manages a banana plantation as his main source of income. He is challenged by low prices for his bananas and poor transport options despite his persistence.<br /><br />Deo has requested a 2,000,000 UGX loan to buy manure to boost his farm's soil nutrition and production. He believes he will become a big Matooke (a variety of starchy banana) trader in Kyavu in the coming years.<br /><br />Deo is thankful that funders support him financially and enable him to provide for his family and, more importantly, educate his children, some of which are graduates.",
