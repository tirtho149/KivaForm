                "description": "This gentleman, Segundo, was born in a place called Datanlí in the municipality of Jinotega, in 1965. He reports that he only went to school for a short time; he spent more time in agricultural work, helping his father. Currently he is married and has 4 children. He works in agriculture. He grows coffee with the help of his older children. Segundo's mother lives close to the place where he lives, and sometimes he goes to visit her. However, the community where his mother lives does not have electric light. For this reason, he is requesting a loan to buy a solar panel which will be installed at his mother's house. He wants his mother and his father to live with light. He loves his parents very much, and he wants them to be able to turn on the switch and have light in the early mornings and in the evenings. He would be very grateful if he is given the opportunity to receive this loan to buy this solar panel. ",
