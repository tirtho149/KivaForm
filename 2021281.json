The leaves and seeds of the dill plant are used for seasoning food and for medicinal purposes.  <br /><br />Taha is requesting a loan to buy dill seeds, organic fertilizers, and equipment to help with cultivation.  He wants to expand his sales into the markets so that he can sell more to other traders.  <br /><br />Taha hopes to increase his income because his wife will have a baby, so he will need to cover her medical expenses.  He looks forward to having a lovely family and wants to provide a stable life for his wife and child.",
