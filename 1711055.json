They instilled him with the work and responsibility; thanks to them, today he works raising livestock. In that way he is responsible for his son, managing to give him a pension every month. <br /><br />Anderson would like to add other calves to his business and for this reason he went to Vision Fund Bank to request the assistance of a loan to be able to realize his goal to increase the number of his livestock.  <br /><br />He hopes to have economic stability so that he can start his own home alongside his son.",
