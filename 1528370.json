He is 31 years old and has five children. Levy has been a farmer for 10 years and is often referred to as a very hardworking individual.<br /><br />Levy isn’t new to One Acre Fund. He actually joined the program in 2015, and has since noticed his life has changed, especially in the sense that he has had more profits from each harvest ever since. This year, Levy will not only get fertilizer and maize seeds as part of his loan, but will also purchase a solar light. He is very excited about this addition since now he will be able to have an overall improved quality of life.<br /><br />Using this loan, Levy's Group will purchase a total of four solar lights and use the farming inputs received to plant a total of five acres.",
