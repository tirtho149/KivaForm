                "description": "Roldan was able to continue his ornamental and landscaping business through the support of Kiva and its lenders. This means a lot to him as this is his main source of income to support his family.<br /><br />Once again Roldan would like to request for a loan in the amount of PHP 50,000 to buy fertilizer, pots, nets, and various seedlings to grow a variety of ornamental plants.  Roldan puts his best efforts to growing healthy and beautiful plants to attract more customers. His income helps cover their daily expense and the school needs of his child.<br /><br />Roldan aims to acquire a delivery truck. He prays for God to bless his business and have an abundant life. He faithfully meets up with his co-fellowship members to share stories of his work every week and where he can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God he studies.<br /><br /> * All CCT community partners / clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital and pay Micro Finance loans.",
