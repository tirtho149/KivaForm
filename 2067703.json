She is 48 years old and married with 4 children.<br /><br />Beatrice likes to think of herself as a very hardworking individual. She has been working alongside One Acre Fund since 2018 and decided to represent her group because she wanted to be more active in her community. She says that being part of the One Acre Fund community has meant that she has been able to consistently feed her family. Beatrice plans to use the profits from this upcoming season to send her children to school.<br /><br />In total, Beatrice’s Group will receive inputs to cultivate 3 acres of land. Given that some members of the group will also be purchasing a solar light using this loan, the group will  receive a total of 4 solar lights.",
