                "description": "Forty-seven-year-old Godfrey does not boast of any academic papers from any agricultural institute, but he is an accomplished farmer from rural Lyantonde and commands a lot of respect.\r\n\r\nHe is happily married, and he and his wife are blessed with a wonderful family.\r\n\r\nFor the past 13 years, Godfrey has been involved in mixed farming, and because of the immense knowledge he has, farmers from their village and neighboring villages troop to his home to seek advice on the best farming techniques.\r\n\r\nGodfrey has identified free space on his farm and wants to fully utilize this space by keeping good quality dairy cows. Dairy farming in the western region is a very profitable venture and milk prices in the recent past have been going up.\r\n\r\nGodfrey, being a visionary and entrepreneurial man, wants to take full advantage of this. He has chosen the breed of cows that he will keep, and he knows that he will not only get milk from the cows but also manure and ghee, and this will boost the fertility of his farm.\r\n\r\nSelling his milk will never be a problem because there is a ready market and he will also be selling to big dairy processing firms.\r\n\r\nGodfrey appreciates the services of Kiva lenders and UGAFODE Microfinance Limited.",
