                "description": "The communal bank 'Los Pinos de Lahuachaca' are going to begin their ninth loan cycle with Pro Mujer, as part of the Patacamaya regional office. The group is made up of eight members, and it is directed by a committee of which Señora Lizith is the president. The members of the group run various businesses. Among them are: a grocery store, and businesses selling vegetables, poultry, beef, food and cooking pots. \r\n\r\nThe loan that they are taking out will benefit these small business owners, including Señora Lizith. She says that it is her first year working with Pro Mujer, and that she joined because of a marketing campaign in her local area. Currently, she has a business selling cooking pots. She says that she was taught this business by her parents over many years. They used to run the business, and she would help them when she was a child.  \r\n\r\nThe loan she is taking out will be used to increase her capital by purchasing cooking pots at wholesale. She will buy them from the wholesalers in the city of La Paz, and after she will sell them at her stall. This way of working allows her to make money and support her family economically, as she is married and has two children. \r\n\r\nWhen she was asked what she liked about Pro Mujer, she said that she liked the training opportunities that the institution offers. \r\n \r\n\r\n",
