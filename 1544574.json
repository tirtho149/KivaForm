As a group leader, she is representing her group of 14 farmers in Webuye District, Kenya. <br /><br />Bilha is returning this season to work with One Acre Fund again, as this means that she is able to earn enough to feed her family, which is why she decided to join in the first place. Bilha says that she is happy to have made that decision because, since she first joined in 2015, she has had a healthier life due to better nutrition, which has improved her day-to-day life significantly. Bilha will use the profits from this season to buy a goat.<br /><br />The group will use this loan to purchase seeds and fertilizer to plant a total of 7.25 acres. Given that some members of the group will also be purchasing a solar light, with this loan, the group will also receive a total of 10 solar lights.",
