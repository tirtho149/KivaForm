She is 45 years old, married and has 2 children.<br /><br />Judith  likes to think of herself as a very reliable person. She has been working alongside One Acre Fund since 2015 and decided to represent her group because she wanted to help other farmers. She says that being part of the One Acre Fund community has enabled her to save more money. Judith plans to use the profits from this coming season to repair her home.<br /><br />In total, Judith's Group will receive inputs to cultivate 3.5 acres of land. Some members of the group will also purchase a solar light with this loan, hence, the group will obtain a total of 7 solar lights.",
