Irene is representing her group of eight farmers in Webuye District and is happy to be working with One Acre Fund for the first time this year.<br /><br />Irene has been a farmer for five years and, in order to have access to the best seed prices, she decided to join the One Acre Fund program this season. Her loan will not only include farming inputs but also a solar light, which she is very happy to be getting as that means she will now have light during dark hours for her children to be able to study. With the profits from this coming season, Irene is planning to send her children to school.<br /><br />A total of two acres will be planted by Irene's Group, and between them they will receive a total of six solar lights.",
