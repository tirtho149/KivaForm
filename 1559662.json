She runs a grocery business, selling fresh organic vegetables and fruits to her customers to sustain her family. Her challenge has been lack of capital to stock her business, which has led it to suffer as she has not been able to meet her demand. She believes that if you assist her with this loan, she will be able to boost her business and increase her revenue, through which she will be able to pay back her loan. Her dream is to be a large supplier of groceries in the future.",
