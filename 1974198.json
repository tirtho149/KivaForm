He does farming alongside operating an electronics shop for daily income and efficient sustainability.<br /><br />Peter's electronics business is not doing well because he is lacking several electronics that are needed by locals in the area. This has given him low returns in the business. <br /><br />For this reason he is seeking a loan to stock the shop with a variety of electronics to increase his client base and increase his sales and income. In the picture, he is seen standing with a credit officer who is wearing blue trousers on the right.<br /><br />Peter will be grateful for any funds allocated—thank you funders!",
