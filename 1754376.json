He is happily married with six biological children all attending school in Kyenjojo, Uganda. He is very hardworking for he has other two dependents he is supporting in his household. <br /><br />Harbert is very proud of his tea growing business for he is able to pay school fees for his children. He also grows sugarcane to get a supplementary income and his aim is to expand the tea plantation in future. However, sometimes the tea yields drop due to prolonged dry seasons, which is a challenge on his side in terms of income.",
