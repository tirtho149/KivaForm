                "description": "José, 35 years old, did not go to school, but he learned to read and write a little while serving in the army, where they were given classes; he was in the army only 3 years. \r\nHe makes his living working on farms—he is well known because he is very good at digging holes to plant coffee plants. Also, in the evenings he works for himself, growing corn and beans to pay for family household expenses. His wife also works as a day laborer on farms with her husband, because they have no other source of income and do it so that their children do not lack anything. \r\nJosé has been doing this work since he was a child, as this is the only source of income in the area. He needs this loan to cancel a loan that he has with another institution, because they charge a higher interest. Also he will invest the money that is left over in his crops. \r\nHe has a dream and says he is working to make it come true: he wants his children to be professionals and do some other kind of work, since what he does is very monotonous. He hopes to always be able to count on the support of CrediCampo in times of need.\r\n",
