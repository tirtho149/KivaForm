One place where he lives in Chuatzam hamlet, a place where the locals are friendly and hard-working. <br /><br />Some time ago, Catalino had the idea to open a business growing coffee. In order to strengthen his income, he also grows bananas. These businesses have greatly helped Catalino as the profits allow him to provide what his family, especially his dear wife, needs.<br /><br />Catalino's wish is to improve his coffee crops, so he has come to ADICLA in order to apply for a loan. He plans to use this loan to buy farming supplies such as manure and insecticide. This will give Catalino the opportunity to continue growing quality coffee for his customers.",
