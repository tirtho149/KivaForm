                "description": "Proscovia is a repeat borrower with UGAFODE Microfinance. She is married and a resident of Nyabicerere, Ishaka district. She has three kids; only two are school-going. <br /><br />She is a qualified primary teacher, making her a salary earner, and is also a farmer — mainly in banana growing and selling. She supplies these bananas to the nearby local market and neighboring districts. She is a resourceful lady in the society in the way that she employs community members for casual labor. <br /><br />She is, however, financially constrained because she is no longer earning a salary since schools were closed due to the pandemic, and her farm needs to be restructured.<br /><br />For this reason she is seeking a loan to buy fertilizers, manure, mulches and banana stems for replanting to increase her production levels.<br /><br />She believes that with these funds, she will be able to regain her financial status. Thank you, funders.",
