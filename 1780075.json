And so Luz works very hard walking the city streets selling her beauty products which are in high demand with her customers due to her low prices and good quality. Luz would like some help to boost her sales so she needs buy products such as perfumes, deodorants, creams, lotions and others. That will enable her to continue supporting her grandchildren and husband,  who is in poor health and unable to work at the moment. That is why Luz has become her family's sole provider with the income she earns from her business.",
