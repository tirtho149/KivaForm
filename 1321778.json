They do not have children and therefore he lives at home with just his partner.<br /><br />Llovanis has been cultivating corn and beans for 20 years. He learned this activity from his father while he helped him work. He then decided to continue because he does not have a complete education that would allow him to get a better job.<br /><br />Besides working his crops, he works as a driver.<br /><br />He has to walk 3 km to go to work the land and his day starts at 6:00 in the morning and ends at 3:00 in the afternoon.<br /><br />The loan will be used to buy seeds, manure, and poison for the cultivation of corn.<br /><br />Llovanis dreams of having dairy cattle.",
