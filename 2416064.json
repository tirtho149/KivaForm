His spouse is a masseuse. He has been potato farming for several years. He owns unused arable land. He wishes to expand his business there. He wants to increase his harvests to make more profits. He is thus taking a loan to increase his financial capital. With this money, he plans to buy seed, fertilizer, manure, and phytosanitary products and to pay for labor. He is going to sell his harvests at the city market. With the previous loan, he was able to put the finishing touches on his house with the profits. With this one, he plans to save up his profits to preserve his children’s future. He is really hoping for the support of the loan funders for this project.",
