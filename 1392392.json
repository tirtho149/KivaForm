She has been a member for a few years now, having joined the program in 2016 and, although she is the only person featured in the above picture, she is actually representing her group of eight farmers in Kilolo North District, Tanzania.<br /><br />Rehema is often described by her community as a very hardworking individual and decided to be the one to represent her group because she wanted to be more active in her community. Like many of her fellow farmers, Rehema decided she wanted to be part of the One Acre Fund community in order to earn enough to send her children to school and hopes to use the profits from this year’s harvest to repair her home.<br /><br />This loan will not only help Rehema but the whole group, who will receive maize seeds and fertilizer to plant a total of 8 acres of land. Additionally, some of the farmers in the group will be purchasing a solar light so, with this loan, the group will also receive one solar light.",
