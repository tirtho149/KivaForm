There is also 1.52 hectares of irrigated land on which she grows clover. In order to further develop her business, she has once again applied to Bai Tushum Bank for a loan of 50,000 KGS. It is for the purchase of field work to grow clover. She plans to use proceeds from the loan to construct a shed, and use part of them to repair the house.",
