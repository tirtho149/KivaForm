                "description": "I grew up in a small town on the island of Oahu, in a town called Mililani. Nothing from my childhood would lead you to believe I would become a farmer. Growing up in a middle-class family in the suburbs farming was the last thing I thought the future held for me. As an adult, I found myself addicted to painkillers. Opioid addiction is very difficult to overcome, and eventually, I  was convicted of possession. I was then given a choice between prison and rehab and decided to turn my life around.\r\n\r\nAfter being released early and having my record expunged for good behavior while on probation, I met the woman of my dreams and had a daughter with her. On this magical journey of being a parent, Jennifer and I began looking at ways to give our child the best possible chance at a healthy and happy life. We struggled during pregnancy to find vegetables that met our standards, so we created Thrive Hawaii Family Farm. Today, I couldn't imagine a life without farming. I am very proud of my family for the progress we have made so far.\r\n\r\nLast year we created (THFF) with the vision of bringing the highest quality, sustainable,  organically grown, freshest produce possible to people on Oahu. We love the idea of getting people together in a social setting and plan to bring the community to the farm to enjoy gatherings and get back in touch with the land.",
