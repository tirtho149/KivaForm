                "description": "Mathew is 54 years old and has 6 children. He has been a farmer for more than 30 years now and is always said to be a very friendly person. Even though Mathew is the only one featured in the above picture, he is actually representing his group formed by 12 farmers in Chwele District, Kenya.\r\n\r\nMathew started working alongside One Acre Fund a few years ago, in 2010, and decided to do so because he wanted to get the best quality fertilizer and hybrid seeds. Since then, he has seen his life improve; especially in the sense that he has been able to consistently feed his family ever since. This year he decided to represent his group because he wanted to be more active in his community.\r\n\r\nMathew’s Group will receive farming inputs to plant a total of 4.5 acres of land. Additionally, some of the farmers in the group will be purchasing a solar light so, with this loan, the group will also receive a total of 7 solar lights.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",
