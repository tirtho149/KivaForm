As a group leader, he is representing his group of 10 farmers in Teso District, Kenya. <br /><br />Geoffrey is returning this season to work with One Acre Fund again as this means that he is able to have access to quality training and acquire new farming methods, which is why he decided to join in the first place. Geoffrey says that he is happy to have made that decision because, since he first joined in 2016, he has been able to consistently feed his family, which has improved his day-to-day life significantly. Geoffrey will use the profits from this season to send his children to school.<br /><br />The group will use this loan to purchase seeds and fertilizer to plant a total of 4.25 acres. Given that a member of the group will also be purchasing a solar light, with this loan the group will also receive one solar light.",
