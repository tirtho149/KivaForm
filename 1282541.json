He is 35 years old, is married and has three children. Ben has been a farmer for more than 20 years and is often referred to as a very hardworking individual.<br /><br />Ben isn’t new to One Acre Fund; he actually joined the program in 2014 and has since noticed his life has changed, especially in the sense that he has been able to consistently feed his family ever since. <br /><br />This year, Ben will not only get fertilizer and maize seeds as part of his loan, but he will also purchase a solar light. He is very excited about this addition since now he will be able to reduce the consumption of paraffin fuel, and therefore, save more money.<br /><br />Using this loan, Ben's Group will purchase a total of nine solar lights and use the farming inputs received to plant a total of 6.5 acres.",
