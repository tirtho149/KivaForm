He belongs to the Lenca ethnic group and for seven years, has worked growing coffee. <br /><br />His farm is located on land outside his home, in the agriculture zone of the same community. His coffee harvest he sells in dry, wet, washed and depulped grains, in the same zone which benefits from coffee. <br /><br />He needs to buy fertilisers, supplies, lime and manures for his coffee farm, which is why he is requesting a 30,000 HNL loan. This will help him obtain a better harvest. <br /><br />His dream is to continue growing coffee and to save so that his crop is debt-free.",
