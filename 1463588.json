He joined One Acre Fund for the first time in 2012 and decided to represent his group because he wanted to spread the story of One Acre Fund farmers. <br /><br />With a portion of this loan, Alex will not only purchase maize seeds and fertilizer for the coming harvesting season, but also a solar light. Receiving a solar light as part of his loan means that now he will be able to have light during the night and have somewhere to charge his phone. Alex plans to use the profits he gains this year to buy a cow.<br /><br />In total, Alex’s Group will use the inputs received from this loan to plant a total of four acres of land. They will also receive a total of five solar lights.",
