His parents have retired from work and get state pensions. The apartment they live in has been deteriorating over the years, so he is requesting a loan of 3,000 USD to renovate it. He will buy building materials such as fiberglass, cement and planks. After the renovation, his aged parents will live in a comfortable and warm place where heat won't be lost easily. ",
