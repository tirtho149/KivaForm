Using the system, the family will grow their corn production avoiding floor contamination and excessive CO2 emission for the well-being of the next generations.<br /><br />Daniel is an example proving to all the small household farmers that it is possible to make a farm a real business opportunity.<br /><br />This loan represents 100% of the price of the biodigester.",
