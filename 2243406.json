Running two businesses at a time is hectic and requires capital availability. <br /><br />He is therefore seeking a loan to buy manure and pesticides to spray his farm that has been hit by the coffee berry borer. With this done he will reduce losses incurred and better the harvest quality. Thank you funders.",
