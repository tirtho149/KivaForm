Agriculture has been his practice by choice now for very long time, according to him. Here  is what he said during his interview with the Branch Assistant:  “I love nature, food, doing physical work and also I love independence. So, this type of activity, has given me all of these. And I am very happy doing agriculture.” \r\n\r\nKimet plants and sells in large quantities mostly potatoes and barley. He has a dairy cow to cover for his family’s dairy needs and also he sells apples from his own orchards. \r\n",
