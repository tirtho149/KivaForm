                "description": "Josephine is a 37-year-old woman who is married to a hard-working farmer. They have six sweet children, with the oldest being twenty-five. He is able to help around the house, with the younger children ranging from different ages down to seven.<br /><br />Josephine and her husband have been blessed to be able to always give their children food while they grow up. But they hope to increase their income slightly with opening up a shop where they can sell livestock.<br /><br />The loan will be used to start a Moringa tree farm. Moringa is a superfood with growing demand globally. The seeds produce oil with medicinal benefits and the leaves are packed with nutrition. <br /><br />The loan will be used to purchase the seed, fertilizer, and pesticides; get adequate water; obtain farm management training; and to hire tractor time to clear the land for planting the farm. <br /><br />This loan is a chance at something greater, a chance to pull them out of life-threatening poverty.",
