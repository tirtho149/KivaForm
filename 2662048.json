When she needed a business to pay the bills, she thought of gardening. She brought more plants and had them in pots. They grew under her watchful eye and careful touch. She sold the plants and flowers that she succeeded with. Her neighbors, relatives and friends were happy to buy such healthy plants from her. <br /><br />It is a new season and it is a chance to grow new plants. A loan will help her get seeds to grow.",
