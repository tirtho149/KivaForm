This helps keep the environment clean and this impacts the community positively. Her job has also helped create employment for those who go collecting the scrap metal for her. <br /><br />She is kindly requesting a loan that will help her to boost her business and she is committed to repaying her loan using the profits she makes. <br /><br />Her dream is to own her own company that will be inherited by her family in the future.",
