                "description": "Mamadou is married and the father of four children. The oldest is 12 years old and the youngest is three. Two of his children are old enough to attend school.<br /><br />He grows bananas and is a member of an economic interest group (GIE) that promotes mutual assistance among the banana growers in the region, facilitates the marketing and provides a joint guarantee. The Chairman of the GIE guarantees all the members.<br /><br />Mamadou grows his bananas on two plots of land, an area of 100 square meters. He has annual production of 10 tons of bananas on the two plots. He has the experience to increase his production, but is limited by the very high cost of good quality agricultural inputs and the lack of financial support to pay for his family's expenses.<br />\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br />Mamadou plans to use the borrowed money to buy six bags of good quality fertilizer, four tons of manure and 60 bundles of straw. This will allow him to boost his yield and the quality of his crops.<br />'<br />With the profits, Mamadou will be able to pay for 80% of his needs, keep his children in school and renovate his house. He will also be able to buy some livestock to diversify his business and increase his revenue so he can buy a mill; the profits will be used to pay for his children's university education.",
