                "description": "Luciano, 64, is married with four children. His oldest son already has his own family, and his three younger sons are excellent students at the school near their town. Luciano's children have become his motivation to work hard every day so that he can offer them a better future and better living conditions.\r\n\r\nFor 30 years, he has been working from home as a carpenter with plenty of effort and dedication. He also has a second business activity as a farmer in his town.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, his goal is to buy construction materials, such as blocks and iron, to build his home. He will then accomplish his greatest dream of building a home to have adequate living conditions.\r\n\r\nOne of his greatest wishes is to be able to sell his products in his town so that people will come to know his work and that of his children. He would also like to give his children an education so that they can become professionals.",
