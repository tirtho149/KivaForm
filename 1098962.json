                "description": "Federico is a 29-year-old smallholder farmer from Chamula, a Tzotzil community from the central Chiapas highlands. With the help of an NGO, a governmental program and FAO, he was able to stop working as a day laborer and begin to work in his own greenhouse where he produces vegetable seedlings to sell to local producers. The main seedlings planted are broccoli, cabbage, lettuce, and cauliflower.<br /><br />Federico recieved a Kiva-funded loan last year for the production of seedlings. He finished paying it in advance.<br /><br />Now, in order to expand his horizons, Federico wants to plant and harvest the seedlings he produces, maximize their production, grow his business and provide the local markets with organic and healthy products.<br /><br />This expansion is a unique opportunity for Federico and his community to grow, not only economically, but also in health and nutrition. For the whole production, Federico uses an eco-friendly process using organic fertilizers such as bokashi, a compost made out of fermented organic matter.<br /><br />His objective is to achieve sustainable management of the ecosystems in order to interrelate the conservation of natural resources with better production levels and put in the market products of quality.<br /><br />With this loan, Federico will be able to move up a link in the production chain, increase his earnings and improve the living conditions for his family.",
