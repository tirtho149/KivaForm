He owns a one-hectare farm where he cares for a herd of four dairy cows, which are fed fresh grass, high-quality hay, and natural fodder that he grows on his own land, ensuring a balanced diet. His cattle produce around 34 liters of milk daily, and part of the milk is used for the production of cheese and other dairy products, diversifying his business and increasing his income.<br /><br />Aureliano lives in a house built in the middle of his land, surrounded by his animals and crops.  <br /><br />A loan of $1,260,334 COP allows Aureliano to purchase vitamin supplements to complement his livestock's diet, improving milk quality and the health of his cows.",
