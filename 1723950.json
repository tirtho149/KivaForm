She is 30 years old, married and has 3 children.<br /><br />Robai likes to think of herself as a very experienced farmer. She has been working alongside One Acre Fund since 2018 and decided to represent her group because she likes being a leader. She says that being part of the One Acre Fund community has meant that she has been able to consistently feed her family. Robai plans to use the profits from this coming season to buy a goat.<br /><br />In total, Robai’s Group will receive inputs to cultivate 4.75 acres of land. Given that some members of the group will also be purchasing a solar light, with this loan, the group will also receive a total of 4 solar lights.",
