Simon's children all attend school. He is a banana farmer and he struggles to make ends meet due to high inflation, unfavorable weather patterns, soil infertility and other issues. Simon is a resourceful person and he compliments his banana production with a small local boutique and goat trade to pay his children's school fees even in such trying times. <br /><br />Simon is requesting a loan to buy manure to improve soil fertility to increase his banana crop. He hopes his loan will give him a rich harvest so he can sell bananas at profitable prices.",
