As a group leader, he is representing his group of 6 farmers in Kimilili District, Kenya. <br /><br />Geoffrey is returning this season to work with One Acre Fund because he is able to earn enough to feed his family, which is why he decided to join in the first place. Geoffrey says that he is happy to have made that decision because, since he first joined in 2016, he has had more profits from each harvest, which has improved his day-to-day life significantly. Geoffrey will use the profits from this season to send his children to school.<br /><br />The group will use this loan to purchase seeds and fertilizer to plant 3.5 acres. Given that some members of the group will also be purchasing a solar light, with this loan, the group will also receive 3 solar lights.",
