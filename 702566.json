They are engaged in different business activities for the elimination of poverty. Three of the women have very low incomes, but this helps them want to struggle harder to get ahead. \n\nOne person who deserves to be highlighted is Renuka. In the picture, she is the lady sitted with her hand raised. She sells vegetables. Through her job, she works to support her family and improve her business and continue growing. She is a very determined person.

The group is very grateful for this opportunity for growth that it is receiving.",
