He deals in selling fresh foods alongside selling pozzolana (cement material) as an additional income. He faces challenges of heavy rains which affect him a lot while transporting food to Kampala the main city where his clients are. However, he has a vision of buying a motorcycle and building rentals in order to have several sources of income. Joseph needs a loan to buy bananas and Irish potatoes for resale.",
