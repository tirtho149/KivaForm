                "description": "This borrower lives in Entre Ríos, Cochabamba, with her family, which is made up of her husband and 4 children. Like many of the people who live in this area, she migrated to the tropics looking for a better future. For this reason, since then, she has worked as much as possible. At first, she worked as an assistant in others' agricultural plots. As time passed, she started saving money and bought her own plot of land, where she currently works. Her products allow her to earn an income in order to support herself.\n\nAs a result of tragic life circumstances, her son suffered a motor vehicle accident, which fractured one of his legs. For this reason, he was admitted to a clinic with deformity, a contused wound, and loss of muscle tissue. According to the medical diagnosis, he requires a left leg amputation due to the loss of muscle tissue. In addition, he has undergone other treatments since he was admitted to the clinic, for which she has used almost all of her and her family's savings. To date, she does not have any other resources. Therefore, the loan that she is requesting will greatly help her cover the costs of her son's amputation and recovery.",
