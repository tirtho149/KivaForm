As a group leader, she is representing her group of 10 farmers in Webuye District, Kenya. \n\nRuth is returning this season to work with One Acre Fund again as this means that she is able to get the best quality fertilizer and hybrid seeds, which is why she decided to join in the first place. Ruth says that she is happy to have made that decision because, since she first joined in 2015, she has been able to save more money, which has improved her day-to-day life significantly. Ruth will use the profits from this season to buy a cow.\n\nThe group will use this loan to purchase seeds and fertilizer to plant a total of 5.5 acres. Given that some members of the group will also be purchasing a solar light, with this loan, the group will also receive a total of 5 solar lights.",
