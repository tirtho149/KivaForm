                "description": "Barau is an industrious maize farmer who lives in a small community in Kaduna. Barau is married with four children, and has always dreamed of a better future for himself and his family. Before joining Babban Gona in 2015, this aspiration seemed out of reach because he got low yields on his farm due to lack of access to quality inputs.<br /><br />With this loan, Barau is on his way to achieving this dream and his goal for this season to be the best performing farmer in his community. Barau will get access to better-yielding seed and fertilizers that will make his crop grow well to ensure an abundant harvest. Apart from increasing Barau’s yield to ensure that his family never goes hungry, this loan will also help him earn up to three times net income, compared to the average Nigerian farmer, from selling his maize to premium markets as a Babban Gona member.<br /><br />With lenders’ support this season, Barau believes that he can enhance his family’s standard of living and he plans to buy a car with the increased earnings from his farm. Barau aspires that his four children will become doctors in the future",
