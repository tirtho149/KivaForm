She is the representative of the group Andro Makha Leikai SHG B and also the featured borrower with her hand raised in the picture. She lived with her family in Andro, Manipur. Piggery and wine-making are the most common activities of this region.<br /><br />Binakumari has been engaged in wine-making for 12 years, and she has been trying her level best to meet the daily needs of her family and also pay for her children's educational fees. Due to financial problems, she is unable to produce more for better profit.<br /><br />Binakumari is applying for a WSDS loan so that she can purchase stock of rice, yeast, and other necessary items required for wine-making so that she could make more wine. This would lead to more income by selling the wine that she produces. She is also looking forward to the loan with great expectations of getting more profit, meeting the needs of her family, and paying for her children's educational fees.<br /><br />Likewise the rest of the members are engaged in activities like piggery, weaving, and wine-making businesses, etc., and are eagerly waiting for the loan to start their respective income-generating activities.",
