His business is going very well and he is generating enough income for his family. \r\n\r\nDue to the upcoming winter weather, the demand for eggs has  increased. To cope with the demand and for generating maximum profit; he wants to buy more hens for producing more eggs to sell. But due to household expenses, utility bills and miscellaneous expenses, he is unable to buy more hens. \r\n\r\nTherefore, M.Akram has requested a loan from Kiva’s field partner BRAC Pakistan, so that he can buy more hens and can get maximum profit in the winter season. \r\n\r\nM.Akram is very thankful to Kiva and field partner BRAC Pakistan. \r\n",
