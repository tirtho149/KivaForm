She is the mother of five children, ages 6 to 19 years old, two of whom attend school.<br /><br />With the ambition of promoting her business, she is making an appeal to a micro-finance institution for a loan that would allow her to buy more lambs at the weekly village market. Alimata sells sheep individually at the local market. In so doing, Alimata makes a monthly profit of between 10,000 and 17,000 f. Part of this income is used to provide for her family's needs and the other part to strengthen her technical capital. To further maximize her profit, she hopes to make manure and organic fertilizer, which she hopes to sell to the gardeners in the village.",
