He is 30 years old, married and has four children.<br /><br />Zacharia likes to think of himself as a very reliable person. He has been working alongside One Acre Fund since 2015 and decided to represent his group because he wanted to help more farmers. He says that being part of the One Acre Fund community has meant that he has been able to consistently feed his family. Zacharia plans to use the profits from this coming season to send his children to school.<br /><br />In total, Zacharia’s Group will receive inputs to cultivate 4.25 acres of land, and one member of the group will also be purchasing a solar light.",
