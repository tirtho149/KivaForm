At this time he is single, and his children are his force for continuing to strive for his goals.<br /><br />He is considered to be a hard-working, honest, and enterprising man. For 10 years he has had a business of [raising and selling] cacao in the dried stage and in the pulp stage.<br /><br />It is for this reason that his great challenge is to keep his crop free from pests in order to increase the quality and quantity of production and to always offer a good product to his customers [so that] they remain satisfied.<br /><br />Additionally, his great dream is to modernize his cultivation.<br /><br />In addition to this business, his other source of income is his contracted services as day laborer, which he does occasionally and which allows him to improve his economic income.<br /><br />He will use the Kiva loan for the maintenance of his parcels [of land], such as pruning and cultivation of the cacao. With the extra earnings, he will improve his house.",
