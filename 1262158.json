She lives in a rural community in the outskirts of Honiara, the capital of the Solomon Islands.\n\nShe owns and operates a small vegetable farm where she used to grow cabbage, tomatoes, green peppers, shallot and eggplants and sells them in her community and the market to earn a living. She has been doing this for 2 years.\n\nWith the her previous loans, she was able to start up her business and help pay for her child's needs. With the opportunity given to her from SPBD staff training on how to run a business, her business grows very well and she is making a very good income.\n\nRose is now applying for a new loan to buy for fertilizers, labor cost and tractor hiring for her farm. She plans to use her profits to build a new home for her family.\n\nShe joined SPBD in 2015 to gain access to financial services.",
