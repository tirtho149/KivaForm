                "description": "With only one rainy season per year in northern Nigeria, maintaining healthy and nutritious food supplies year-round or during periods of drought can be challenging for farmers. <br /><br />Luckily, as a Babban Gona maize farmer, Shehu receives crop insurance and access to high quality inputs and services, so he does not have to worry about failed crops or poor harvests. This means Shehu has a more predictable income, which he can use to access more nutritious food and increase year-round caloric consumption for his family. Through this loan, known as a harvest advance loan, Shehu will receive a cash advance, equal to the price of his maize, that allows him to buy more nutritious food for the family while Babban Gona stores his maize to sell in the future at a better price. <br /><br />With his increased income, Shehu will be able to enjoy a healthier life, and also help out other members of his Trust Group and village to build a more productive community.",
