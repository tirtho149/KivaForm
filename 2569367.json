For 18 years, he has been engaged in raising livestock and growing crops as his main source of income. His property has all the conditions needed for keeping livestock. <br /><br />Thanks to his hard work, his farm currently has 2 cows and 15 sheep. Thanks to the cows, Edik sells organic milk every day. In order to further develop his business, he applied to Bai Tushum Bank for a loan of 70,000 KGS to carry out field work and purchase livestock. The income from the loan will help improve his financial situation. Edik thanks all of Kiva's lenders for their support and wishes them all the best.",
