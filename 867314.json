Even though Benard is the only one featured in the above picture, he is actually representing his group of 16 farmers in Kakamega South District, Kenya.\r\n\r\nBenard started working alongside One Acre Fund a few years ago, in 2010, and decided to do so because he wanted to earn enough to feed his family. Since then, he has seen his life improve; especially in the sense that he has had more profits from each harvest ever since. This year he decided to represent his group because he wanted to help more farmers.\r\n\r\nBenard’s Group will receive farming inputs to plant a total of 9.75 acres of land. Additionally, some of the farmers in the group will be purchasing a solar light so, with this loan, the group will also receive a total of three solar lights.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n",
