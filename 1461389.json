As a group leader, she is representing her group of 13 farmers in Kimilili District, Kenya. <br /><br />Eunice is returning this season to work with One Acre Fund again as this means that she is able to have access to the best seed prices, which is why she decided to join in the first place. Eunice says that she is happy to have made that decision because, since she first joined in 2013, she has had more profits from each harvest, which has improved her day-to-day life significantly. Eunice will use the profits from this season to send her children to school.<br /><br />The group will use this loan to purchase seeds and fertilizer to plant a total of 10 acres. Given that some members of the group will also be purchasing a solar light, with this loan, the group will also receive a total of 4 solar lights.",
