As a group leader, she is representing her group of seven farmers in Teso District, Kenya. <br /><br />Margret is returning this season to work with One Acre Fund again as this means that she is able to get the best-quality fertilizer and hybrid seeds, which is why she decided to join in the first place. Margret says that she is happy to have made that decision because, since she first joined in 2015, she has been able to consistently feed her family, which has improved her day-to-day life significantly. Margret will use the profits from this season to send her children to school.<br /><br />The group will use this loan to purchase seeds and fertilizer to plant a total of 4.5 acres. One member of the group will also purchase a solar light with this loan.",
