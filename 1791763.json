He is married and lives with his wife and children. <br /><br />He wants this loan in order to buy supplies, fertilisers and manures for his sugar cane crops, and thereby offer his customers a higher-quality product. German hopes that this investment will give his family a higher quality of life and more financial stability. He can then continue to grow as a person and small-time businessperson. <br /><br />This is German’s second loan from FUDECOSUR. German has not received other loans from state banks. FUDECOSUR has provided this loan with better facilities and much lower interest rates.",
