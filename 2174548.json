He is looking forward to be working with One Acre Fund for the first time this year, as this means he will get the best quality fertilizer and hybrid seeds. <br /><br />He has been a farmer for more than 20 years and is often described as a very hardworking individual. He decided to represent his group because he was just proposed by the team. With the profits he earns from this coming season, Joseph would like to send his children to school.<br /><br />Between the 11 farmers in Joseph’s Group, six acres will be planted using the inputs from this loan.",
