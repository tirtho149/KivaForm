She works hard to support her family and provide them with a better life. For the past two years she has sold sorghum. Every morning she opens her shop at 6 a.m. and works tirelessly until her daily supply is sold. This group is happy to report that they are repeat clients and they have paid their loans on time.<br /><br />She is requesting a loan from Kiva via Vision Finance Company to expand her business buy purchasing more sorghum to sell, which will eventually lead to increasing her profit. She is hoping that this loan will allow her to expand her standard of living. With the profits, she will be able to get medical insurance for her family and pay school fees for her two children.",
