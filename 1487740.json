She has received diverse training in growing techniques and the management and processing of cacao.

In addition, she makes her own organic fertilizers that she uses on her plants.<br /><br />With the loan, she will purchase molds, machines to grind cacao, and raw materials for her project. She wants her business to grow so that it allows her to give better opportunities to her daughter.",
