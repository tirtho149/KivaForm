                "description": "Sabina, 58, has spent many years working in agriculture which has been the only source of income for her family for generations.  She was able to study until fifth grade despite the fact that her parents' economic situation was not the best.  She is married and has four adult children.  Her husband is the one who supports her most in the field.  For over 20 years she has been growing coffee which has been the main business for the family for generations.  When she was very young her parents taught her what she needed to know.  They were the ones who passed on part of the land where she grows the coffee.  She bought the rest of the land through much effort with her husband and it is located near their home.\r\n\r\nSabina wants to expand her coffee plantation and continue buying more land to consolidate her property and earn more income at harvest time.  This will improve the family economy.  She plans to use the profit from coffee bean sales to carry out home improvements and meet her commitment of continuing to expand her property.\r\n\r\nOn this occasion, Sabina is requesting a loan to buy fertilizers, composts, and leaf treatment as well as hire labor to clean and fertilize the coffee. She hopes to improve her harvest this year with the support of different KIVA lenders.",
