                "description": "Violet is 47 years old and has nine children. She is a group leader and is representing her group formed by six farmers in Matete District, Kenya. <br /><br />Violet has been farming with One Acre Fund for years now, having joined the program for the first time in 2009. This decision was largely a result of her desire to get the best quality fertilizer and hybrid seeds and, although she described her last harvest as good, she believes she could have a better one this year by continuing to work alongside One Acre Fund. Violet also decided to purchase a solar light as part of her loan, which she is very excited about, as it will allow her to have light during dark hours for her children to be able to study.<br /><br />Obtaining this loan means that Violet's Group will be able to receive a total of three solar lights, as well as farming inputs to plant a total of 4.5 acres.",
