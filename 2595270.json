The lack of employment has affected both the urban and rural areas, which has impacted many young people like Natalia.  As a result, they have chosen to start their own businesses, including farming and raising animals.  These types of skills are learned at a very young age.  In this manner, they are able to provide financial support for their households and cover their expenses independently.     <br /><br />Natalia has chosen to cultivate potatoes of the Capiro variety.  For this reason, she is requesting a loan to buy composts, fertilizers, and other farming supplies so that she can improve the profitability of her business and achieve a good harvest of potatoes.",
