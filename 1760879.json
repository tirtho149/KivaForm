Her loan will not only include farming inputs but also a solar light, which she is very happy to be getting as that means she will now have light during dark hours for her children to be able to study. With the profits from this coming season, Jane is planning to send her children to school.\n\nA total of 1 acres will be planted by Jane's Group, and between them they will receive a total of 7 solar lights.",
