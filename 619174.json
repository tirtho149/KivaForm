                "description": "Kamandar is from the village of Karajala. He is 44 years old, married, and lives with his wife, son, and daughter-in-law. \r\n\r\nThe source of income for the family is an agricultural business. In particular, they grow tomatoes, cucumbers, and beans in the greenhouses and sell the harvested products locally. Besides, he has three milk cows and a calf. Kamandar’s wife produces cheese with the milk for selling. \r\n\r\nKamandar has Azerbaijanian origins, but his family has lived in Georgia for a long time.  He is a very hard-working man with a strong desire to get more income and ensure his family members better living conditions.\r\n\r\nKamandar has noticed high demand for fish in the market. In response to the local market demand, he has requested credit to finance the costs of cleaning his pond and purchasing local species of fish. Beginning in the spring season, the fish will start to spawn and after a year they can be intensively sold. \r\n\r\nKamandar expects that development of the fish farm will raise the income of the family. Part of the increase in income will be reinvested in the same business, and the other part will be used for improving the living conditions of the family.\r\n\r\n",
