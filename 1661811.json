She joined One Acre Fund for the first time in 2013 and decided to represent her group because she wanted to help more farmers. <br /><br />With a portion of this loan, Leonidah will not only purchase maize seeds and fertilizer for the coming harvesting season, but also a solar light. Receiving a solar light as part of her loan means that now she will be able to have light during the night and have somewhere to charge her phone. <br /><br />Leonidah plans to use the profits she gains this year to send her children to school.<br /><br />In total Leonidah’s Group will use the inputs received from this loan to plant a total of four acres of land. They will also receive a total of five solar lights.",
