He has always been recognized by the people around him as a hard-working, responsible and enterprising man, who really likes field work such as agriculture and livestock, which he does with his wife who has always supported him in each of his ventures so they have been able to get their family ahead hand in hand. <br />Jose currently has one hectare of strawberries planted which he must take very good care of, which is why he is requesting a loan with which he will buy agricultural inputs, fertilizers, organic fertilizers, compost, among other inputs, necessary for the good care and maintenance of his crop, since this product allows Jose two harvests each month. For this reason he hopes in the future to have a larger lot planted with strawberries, as well as to be able to give his son a good higher education and for him to take care of his crops when he is older in a technical way.",
