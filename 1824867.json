This loan group is formed by 12 members, 10 women and 2 men. The group meets in one of the member's homes every 15 days. <br /><br />Maria Karina is the president of the group. She's 45 years old, is a lawyer, has no children, and lives with her parents. For several years, to help her elderly parents who don't work, Maria Karina has ran a small store in her home, where she sells a great variety of products including rice, sugar, oils, detergents, beans, vegetables, and fruits. She works every day from 6:00 AM to 8:00 PM, and sometimes even later. She works as a lawyer when her services are requested. <br /><br />With this new loan she will buy supplies to offer in her small store. Her dream is that her mother will be healthy and that her business will continue growing.",
