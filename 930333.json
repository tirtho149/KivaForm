For more than 10 years, she has been farming rice and working as a tailor at home to make a living. She can earn about KHR 50,000 per day and manages to save about 20,000 KHR each day for future needs. \r\n\r\nSokneang has never been with VisionFund before. She is now going to apply for a loan to buy more fabric for her tailoring business and also to buy fertilizer for her farmland. She hopes this loan will enable her to expand her farmland as well as her tailoring business to gain more income for supporting her child's education. \r\n",
