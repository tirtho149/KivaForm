She is 56 years old, married and has 4 children.<br /><br />Sarah likes to think of herself as a very experienced farmer. She has been working alongside One Acre Fund since 2014 and decided to represent her group because she wanted to help more farmers. She says that being part of the One Acre Fund community has meant that she has had a healthier life due to better nutrition. Sarah plans to use the profits from this coming season to send her children to school.<br /><br />In total, Sarah’s Group will receive inputs to cultivate 10.5 acres of land. Given that a member of the group will also be purchasing a solar light, with this loan, the group will also receive 1 solar light.",
