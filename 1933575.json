As a group leader, he is representing his group of six farmers in Alego District, Kenya. <br /><br />Paul is returning this season to work with One Acre Fund again as this means that he is able to get the best quality fertilizer and hybrid seeds, which is why he decided to join in the first place. Paul says that he is happy to have made that decision because, since he first joined in 2016, he has been able to consistently feed his family, which has improved his day-to-day life significantly. Paul will use the profits from this season to save more money for the future.<br /><br />The group will use this loan to purchase seeds and fertilizer to plant a total of 2.25 acres.",
