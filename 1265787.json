                "description": "Christine is 62 years old and has six children. She is a group leader and is representing her group of 13 farmers in Sirisia District, Kenya. <br /><br />Christine has been farming with One Acre Fund for years now, having joined the program for the first time in 2011. This decision was largely a result of her desire to have access to quality training and acquire new farming methods and, although she described her last harvest as poor, she believes she could have a better one this year by continuing to work alongside One Acre Fund.<br /><br />Christine also decided to purchase a solar light as part of her loan, which she is very excited about. It will allow her to reduce the consumption of paraffin fuel and therefore save more money.<br /><br />Obtaining this loan means that Christine's group will be able to receive a total of nine solar lights, as well as farming inputs to plant a total of 11.5 acres.",
