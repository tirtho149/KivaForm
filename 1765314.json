Given that farming is a seasonal business, he saved up some money that he invested in a small bar to supplement his income.<br /><br />He works from Monday to Sunday. Alex is a true hard worker who struggles tirelessly to make his dream of having his own home and living a dignified life a reality. <br /><br />He is asking for a loan to invest in his farming business to buy fertilizers and mulch. Alex is positive that he will have a good harvest, which will bring in more income for the family's survival.<br /><br />Alex appreciates the support.",
