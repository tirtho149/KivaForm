She has been a member for a few years now, having joined the program in 2015 and, although she is the only person featured in the above picture, she is actually representing her group of seven farmers in Webuye District, Kenya.<br /><br />Doricus is often described by her community as a very hardworking individual and decided to be the one to represent her group because she wanted to spread the story of OAF farmers. <br /><br />Like many of her fellow farmers, Doricus decided she wanted to be part of the One Acre Fund community in order to earn enough to feed her family and hopes to use the profits from this year’s harvest to invest in a business.<br /><br />This loan will not only help Doricus but the whole group, who will receive maize seeds and fertilizer to plant a total of 3.75 acres of land. Additionally, some of the farmers in the group will be purchasing a solar light so, with this loan, the group will also receive a total of three solar lights.",
