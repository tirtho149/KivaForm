After the flowers are grown, she then sells them at the local market and some times people come to buy at her place. She has been making a living from her flowers farm for many years now with her own working capital. <br /><br />Now, she is requesting a $1,000 USD loan through KIF to help with her farming activity. Every day she is busy with farming because she is earning a good income from it. Joana will use this loan to buy more manure, fertilizer, some new type of flower seeds, and new farming equipment to grow more flowers to sell.",
