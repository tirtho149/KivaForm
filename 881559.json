                "description": "Keneshbu is a 55-year-old widow and a mother of three children. She has a high school degree. Her family’s primary sources of income are livestock breeding and agriculture. Keneshbu started out back in 2005. Thanks to her hard work, Keneshbu owns three cows. She grows beans for sale on her plot of land the size of 4 hectares. Her monthly income is about 15,000 Kyrgyz som (KGS) but this amount of money is not enough for a dignified life. Keneshbu turned to Bai-Tushim bank for a loan of 100,000 Kyrgyz som (KGS) in order to expand her business. The loan will help her to buy additional livestock and fertilizers for land cultivation and growing organic haricot. She plans to invest the profit in further business development as well as the improvement of her family’s well-being.",
