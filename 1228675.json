                "description": "Tei Kone-2 (D) Village Group is located in Mahlaing Township and this village has 150 households.  People in this village earn their livelihood by farming, breeding livestock and some, especially young people, go to cities or abroad in search of job opportunities. Mahlaing Township is famous for its agricultural products like sesame, cotton and maize. <br /><br />Kyaw, Thidar, Tun, Kyu, Aung and Tin are loan clients in this village group. But in the picture, since Kyaw was sick and couldn't come, only five of them can be shown. Tun (in the middle) is a 45-year-old farmer living with his seven family members. He always strives for the betterment of his family. <br /><br />Tun has been farming since he started his own family. Moreover, he is very passionate about farming and loves cultivating his farm. This new loan will be used for purchasing farming inputs such as seeds, pesticides and high quality fertilizers to yield more nourished crops so that it will create a better income for his family and his school-going children.",
