                "description": "Liberian cocoa beans have been discounted on the world market due to inconsistent and poor quality due to absence of extension services, inadequate storage practices and minimal access to finance. Moreover, the bulk cocoa market holds producers in a cycle of poverty and there are currently no Fairtrade certified cocoa products that are produced in Liberia, despite the country offering fertile soil and optimal climate.\n\nLiberia Cocoa Corporation (LCC) is a locally-owned social enterprise focused on producing and selling organic and Fairtrade certified Liberian cocoa through farmer training. LCC’s objective is to prove that premium certified organic cocoa beans and organic chocolate can be produced at scale in Liberia. LCC has developed large-scale cocoa aggregation and improved production and post-harvest activities through supervised Farmer Field Schools and tailored extension services (including improved fermentation and drying techniques). Raising the overall quality of Liberian cocoa beans, coupled with the use of centralized post-harvest processing techniques, will enable farmers to earn higher net incomes. \n\nTo date, the company has successfully trained roughly 3,000 community farmers.\n\nKiva’s loan will enable LCC to provide training and organic certification for 522 smallholder farmers and their households (approx. 2,610 Liberians indirectly benefiting). This is LCC’s first loan through the Kiva Labs Social Enterprise program. \n",
