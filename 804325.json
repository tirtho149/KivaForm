                "description": "Shadrack is a smallholder farmer from the village of Kaplamai in the Nandihills area of Kenya. When you ask, he’ll tell you his most valuable asset is his two-quarters-of-an-acre farm. But it wasn’t always this way. \r\n\r\nFor a long time, Shadrack’s farm couldn’t even sustain his family. In 2012, Shadrack heard about Juhudi Kilimo, a micro-finance institution that serves smallholder farmers. And from that day, life has never been the same. \r\n\r\nShadrack is happily married and, together with his beautiful wife, he is blessed with one lovely child. For the past 10 years, he has been practicing mixed farming and his primary sources of income have been milk, eggs and a variety of food crops. He sells milk and farm produce to his neighbors and to the local market. However, he has been facing one big problem and that is timely delivery of the products to the market. He is seeking a loan to buy a motorbike that would solve his transportation problem. \r\n\r\nKaplamai is located in a very remote area that has a poor road network and the terrain is very bad. The only mode of transport is a motorbike. This loan will be of great help because it will allow Shadrack to transport his farm products to the market and deliver them in a timely manner. \r\n\r\nMilk and vegetables are very perishable and require timely delivery to the market if you are to fetch high prices. Through the loan, Shadrack will not be worried because he will always be able to deliver the products on time and gain more profits. This motorbike will be a reliable source for quick transportation for both long and short distances. \r\n\r\nThrough the motorbike, Shadrack's life is going to change and his standard of living is going to improve.\r\n\r\n",
