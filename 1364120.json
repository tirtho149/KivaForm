This will help to keep away the weeds and pests, and therefore, further boost the yield and increase the sales.<br /><br />This will help him overcome the challenge of limited capital and changes in weather conditions that affect his yields.<br /><br />He is honest and hardworking, and he appreciates UGAFODE for the good services being rendered to its clients, especially farmers.",
