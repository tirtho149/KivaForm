He wants the loan for the purchase of fertilizers, compost, and materials that are needed to improve and treat his bean crop. <br /><br />He hopes that this investment will provide his family with a better quality of life and greater financial stability. He also hopes to be able to continue growing as a person and a small business owner. <br /><br />This is the second loan he has received from FUDECOSUR. He has not had other loans at state banks, but FUDECOSUR has provided the loan with better payment terms and a much lower interest rate.",
