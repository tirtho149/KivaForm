                "description": "Kimhuai is a 49-year-old married woman who lives with her husband and children in a small weaving community in Surin province, Thailand. All her children work independently and her husband works as a farmer cultivating rice for a living. Her family also earns income through raising cows and Kimhuai runs a small business in raising silkworms to sell. <br /><br />Her sericulture business has been operating for over six years. When Kimhuai was young, she learned to raise silkworms from her mother. She raises thousands of cocoons and produces silk yarn to sell to silk weavers. This business has enabled her to generate income to use for daily expenses. During this season, there is a high demand for silk fabric, so she needs to produce more cocoons to meet customers' requirements. She desires to expand her sericulture business to a larger scale and open a shop selling silk thread and other weaving supplies. <br /><br />Therefore, Kimhuai is requesting a second loan to purchase bamboo threshing baskets, wood sticks, muslin cloth, and other essential supplies for raising silkworms. She is confident that this loan will enable her to work more quickly and efficiently, which will gradually increase her income, allowing her to improve the standard of living for her family, and continue to grow her business.",
