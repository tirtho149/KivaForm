                "description": "Boymakhmad is a kind and hardworking man.  He is married and has two grown sons.  The sons are working in Russia and send money to the parents every month.  Boymakhmad lives with his wife is a small house in a rural village.  He is full of strength and desire to work for the benefit of his family.  Boymakhmad is involved in farming and animal husbandry.  He has about 7 hectares of land, where he grows agricultural crops, such as wheat and cotton.  And his wife helps him with running the business by taking care and raising livestock.  Because their land is large, they also take livestock to pasture there.  The animal husbandry business yields a good income and this is why Boymakhmad wants to expand it by increasing livestock headcount.  This is why he came to Arvand to obtain a loan to buy livestock.  Boymakhmad thanks Arvand for the support in advance.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
