She is 34 years old, is married and has 4 children. Edith has been a farmer for 13 years and is often referred to as a very experienced farmer.<br /><br />Edith isn’t new to One Acre Fund, she actually joined the program in 2015 and has since noticed her life has changed; especially in the sense that she has had more profits from each harvest ever since. This year, Edith will not only get fertilizer and maize seeds as part of her loan, but will also purchase a solar light. She is very excited about this addition since now she will be able to reduce the consumption of paraffin fuel and therefore save more money.<br /><br />Using this loan, Edith's Group will purchase a total of 7 solar lights and use the farming inputs received to plant a total of 7.5 acres.",
