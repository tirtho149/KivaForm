Aged 37, Mamou lives in a family of 10 persons of whom six are children. <br /><br />Mamou, who became a farmer because of family tradition, registered with myAgro because of the \"little by little\" system of payment. For her second year with myAgro, Mamou bought fertilizer for growing peanuts and okra for her field of 1/8 hectare. She hopes to improve her yield so that she can invest a part of the generated income in raising sheep and goats and in small-sale retailing.",
