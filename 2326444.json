After the garlic is grown and ripe, he harvests it and brings it to the market to sell. He has been planting garlic for a year now with his own working capital.<br /><br />He is requesting a loan of $500 through KIF to help him improve his business. Every day, he is planting and looking after the farm because he makes a living from it, earning a good income for his loving family. <br /><br />He plans to use this loan to buy more manure, vegetable seeds, and new farming equipment in order to increase the amount of vegetables in the coming harvest.",
