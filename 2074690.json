                "description": "Following Musa's initial loan request, he has been able to purchase improved inputs and he is delighted on the prospects this holds. As a hardworking farmer, Musa further has the ambition to provide his family with better healthcare from the profits of farming. As a member of Babban Gona, Musa has access to enhanced farming services which help to increase his yields. Furthermore, through training programs, Musa now practices farming in a more sustainable manner. For example, the agronomy education Musa receives focuses on micro-dosing fertilizers to lessen environmental impact and increase yields. Musa expects to reap 40 bags/hectare of maize from this year's harvest, more than double the national Nigerian average of 18 bags/hectare. <br /><br />This Harvest Advance loan will provide Musa with cash equivalent to his value of maize at harvest. Babban Gona will then help Musa to store his maize and sell it at a higher price over the next six to nine months, guaranteeing higher returns. This is crucial for Musa as he plans on using the profit from this harvest to get better healthcare for his family.",
