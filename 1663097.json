As a group leader, he is representing his group of 13 farmers in Mumias District, Kenya. <br /><br />Simon is returning this season to work with One Acre Fund again, as this means that he is able to earn enough to feed his family, which is why he decided to join in the first place. Simon says that he is happy to have made that decision because, since he first joined in 2014, he has been able to consistently feed his family. This has improved his day-to-day life significantly. Simon will use the profits from this season to send his children to school.<br /><br />The group will use this loan to purchase seeds and fertilizer to plant a total of 5.25 acres. Given that some members of the group will also be purchasing a solar light, with this loan, the group will also receive a total of six solar lights.",
