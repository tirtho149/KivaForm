                "description": "Caterline (a 47-year-old mom of 6 pictured in her tea crop farm) has surprised many people in Kenyenya with her intense goodness. She is a proud mum of cute children, whom she really adores and cherishes. She is an active woman who works in agriculture, a skill that she inherited from her parents. Also, she engages in some small business activities,<br /><br />Caterline has been a very hardworking mixed farmer for many years, growing tea and keeping dairy cows. Through these activities, she has been able to earn a decent and honest income. <br /><br />Although Caterline has been making profits through farming, not everything has been easy for this humble and industrious mother. Her farm has not been producing as much of a harvest lately due to a lack of fertilizer. That is why she is seeking a loan to buy farm inputs such as nutrient-rich fertilizers to improve her tea crop farm. Through this loan, Caterline will be assured a bumper tea crop harvest, which will mean more profits and income. Using this loan, she will be able to expand her enterprise. <br /><br />Caterline hopes you will consider her appeal for the loan. It would mean a lot to her and her family. Brighten up spirits this year season by granting her a loan!",
