                "description": "Khalid, who appears in the photo, is a 28-year-old, married man from Khan Younis, Gaza Strip, which is both a city and a refugee camp. He lives with his family in a small, old house, and is a father of two kids. He is the only breadwinner of the family, and they depend on him for support. Khalid has a business in the city. He keeps beehives and sell honey in his district and adjacent areas. It is a good business and provides him with a good income, but the economic situation in the Gaza Strip is bad because of recent conflict. Khalid went to Palestine for Credit & Development FATEN to request a US Dollar loan to buy new beehives to increase honey production. He hopes that this new inventory will enable him to increase his sales, customers and eventually save enough income to expand his business.",
