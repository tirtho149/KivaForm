                "description": "In Remanyanki B village in Kuria East, Kenya, Danny has volunteered to be the promoter for a new chlorine dispenser program. Danny is a friendly member of the community with 3 children. Danny lives with his family in a house made of mud walls, a dirt floor and an iron roof.\n\nRemanyanki B village does not have a piped water supply, so the community collects their water from a local spring. This water is easily contaminated with bacteria that can cause water-borne diseases. Chlorine dispensers offer a solution to this problem by allowing people to treat their water to make it safe to drink. Danny’s community using the local water source need a loan to cover the cost of installing and maintaining chlorine dispensers at the water sources in the area. \n\nDanny has volunteered to be the promoter to encourage the community to use the dispenser and to refill it with chlorine when the tank runs low. Danny volunteered to be the promoter because he wants to help his community by access safe water. There are also 3 other volunteer promoters from the surrounding community who are part of this group loan: Paul, Protus, and Rozaria.\n\nThe Kiva loan will be repaid by Evidence Action (www.evidenceaction.org) on behalf of the community through the sale of carbon credits. Using the chlorine dispenser generates carbon credits by avoiding the need to boil water to make it safe to drink. Revenues from the sale of carbon credits to organizations and individuals wanting to reduce their carbon footprints will be used to repay Kiva lenders and also to make sure that Danny’s community can have access to safe water now and in the future.\n",
