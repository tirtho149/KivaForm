His father works in the post office but Rrezart helps with the expenses and family by delivering pizza for Proper Pizza and is also a bee keeper, tending to his bees to sell the honey. For the first time, he is requesting a loan in order to purchase more bees so that he can produce more honey for his family and for sales. He is very ambitious and hopes in the near future to have a large private business and dreams of many ways to ensure his success. Knowing that this is a Kiva loan, he wants to thank all of the lenders for their support. \r\n",
