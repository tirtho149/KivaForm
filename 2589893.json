He runs his own homestead farm and has a small parcel of land used to earn the livelihood for the family. He is well-known among his fellows for his hardworking nature in farming cattle and land where he grows green vegetables.<br /><br />SM.Nasir wants to buy a biodigester because he wants to produce organic vegetables to sell in the market. The biodigester will convert animal manure into a biogas for use in daily cooking and organic fertilizer for farming.<br /><br />Having a loan to buy a biodigester to obtain cheaper solutions of biogas and fertilizers, will save SM.Nasir  a great deal of money and time for cooking fuel and organic fertilizers. That will in turn boost his farming activities.",
