He is a father to 7 children and is known by his community as a very hardworking individual.<br /><br />Ronald joined One Acre Fund in 2012 because he wanted to earn enough to feed his family. Since he joined the program, he says that his life has improved, especially because he has had more profits from each harvest. With the profits from the coming harvesting season, Ronald plans to send his children to school.<br /><br />Between the 10 farmers in Ronald's Group, a total of 4 acres of land will be planted using the maize seeds and fertilizer received with the loan. Additionally, some of the farmers in the group will be purchasing solar lights. With this loan, the group will receive a total of 5 solar lights.",
