Her main source of income is from planting cassava, which she has been doing for 19 years. She also does rice farming for extra income. Both plantations allow her to save around 7 USD a day.\r\n\r\nMet is not new with VisionFund, Kiva’s partner. She has successfully completed three cycles already. For her fourth cycle and leading her group of two, she is applying for a loan of 2,000,000 KHR to hire workers to plough her field and also to buy fertilizer and cassava stems for her plantation. She wishes to expand her business and would like all of her children to continue to receive an education.",
