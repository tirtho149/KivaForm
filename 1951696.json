Most of the time he does his daily activities by planting and looking after his vegetables. After the vegetables are grown, he usually harvests and then transports them to local markets to sell. He has been growing and selling vegetables for many years now with his own working capital. <br /><br />He previously borrowed and repaid all of his loan on time. Now, he is requesting a loan of 1,500 USD from KIF to help with his agriculture. Every day he is busy with farming because he makes a living from it.
