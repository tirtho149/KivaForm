He is 31 years old, married and a father of two children who attend school. He does maize and beans farming as his economic activity. He has greatly benefited from the Hand in Hand Eastern Africa training, which equipped him with skills to effectively manage his business.\r\n \r\nHe is borrowing from Kiva to purchase farm inputs such as manure and fertilizer. He hopes this will enable him to boost his farming and hence increase his income. He will, therefore be able to improve the living standards of his family, which includes quality education and modern housing.\r\n\r\nHezekiah is grateful to Kiva and their lenders and promises to repay promptly.\r\n",
