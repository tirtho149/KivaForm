                "description": "The problem\n<p>Smallholder maize farmers in Cameroon cannot use their land to its full potential. They do not have access to quality seeds. Nearly 30% of the harvest is lost due to poor post-harvest management as humidity levels are above 86%. They have no access to drying and storage facilities. Their farm yields are low: less than 2 tons per hectare per season, well below the global average of 5 tons per hectare. Their income is also low as they sell their crops to intermediaries at a low price because they are not connected to markets.<p> \n\nThe solution\n<p><a href=\"http://www.grassland-africa.com/\">Grassland Cameroon</a> gives farmers access to better seeds, trainings, technical assistance and buys maize from the their farmers at a higher price than regular intermediaries. By distributing superior seeds, training farmers on good agronomic practices, and industrially drying grain with their machinery, Grassland Cameroon ensures that their farmers produce premium quality maize, which fetches them higher prices in the market.<p> \n\nImpact\n<p>Since 2016, Grassland Cameroon has worked with 300 farmers, increasing their yields from 1.9 tons per hectare to 4.6 tons per hectare per planting season. Similarly, annual incomes for participating farmers have increased by over 10% in one year and are projected to double by their third year in their program (2019/2020).<p>",
