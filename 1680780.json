To provide for his family he is engaged in agricultural activity. He currently has three cows and wants to add another one, this is why he is asking for a loan for the first time in his life.<br /><br />\"I think that I will easily manage to keep another cow and this will increase my family income significantly. I heard about Kiva from my neighbor, who has already bought a cow and has increased his family income. I hope Kiva lenders can help me too!\" said Dashamir hopefully during the interview. <br /><br />Dashamir hopes one day he will have a big farm and even a restaurant on it, since his wife worked as a cook when they were emigrants in Greece.",
