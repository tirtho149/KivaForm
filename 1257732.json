                "description": "Beatrice is 52 years old and has 8 children. She is a group leader and is representing her group formed by 16 farmers in Teso District, Kenya. <br /><br />Beatrice has been farming with One Acre Fund for years now, having joined the program for the first time in 2012. This decision was largely a result of her desire to have access to quality training and acquire new farming methods. Although she describes her last harvest as good, she believes she can have a better one this year by continuing to work alongside One Acre Fund. <br /><br />Beatrice also decided to purchase a solar light as part of her loan, which she is very excited about, as it will allow her to have light during the night and have somewhere to charge her phone.<br /><br />Obtaining this loan means that Beatrice's group will be able to receive a total of 3 solar lights as well as farming inputs to plant a total of 8 acres.",
