He is a father to 8 children and is known by his community as a very hardworking individual.<br /><br />Initially, Nathaniel  joined One Acre Fund in 2012 because he wanted to get the best quality fertilizer and hybrid seeds. Since he joined the program he says that his life has improved, especially because he has been able to save more money. With the profits from the coming harvesting season, Nathaniel plans to send his children to school.<br /><br />Between the 15 farmers in Nathaniel 's Group, a total of 13.25 acres of land will be planted using the maize seeds and fertilizer received with the loan. Additionally, some of the farmers in the group will be purchasing a solar light, so with this loan the group will also receive a total of 2 solar lights.",
