Justus is a group leader who is representing eight farmers from Teso District.  Since joining One Acre Fund in 2018, he has noticed that he has been able to consistently feed his family.<br /><br />Justus described his harvest last year as good, but he believes he can have a better one this year by continuing to work with One Acre Fund.  He is very excited to also be purchasing a solar light, in addition to fertilizer and maize seeds, because he will now be able to have light during the dark hours so that his children will be able to study.  With the profits from this season’s harvest, he plans to send his children to school.<br /><br />With this loan, Justus’ group will be able to plant a total of 5.75 acres of land and purchase a total of two solar lights.",
