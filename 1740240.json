Tania lives with her mother in a very humble small house. She works part-time cleaning a house and dedicates the rest of her time to raising animals, such as chickens and pigs. This is how she strives so that she and her son do not lack daily food. <br /><br />Tania says that her pig sales are down, so she wants to promote her business of raising chickens. She found out about Banco Vison Fund Ecuador and their support of small entrepreneurs thanks to her aunt. Tania is requesting help to purchase chickens, corn, potatoes, cabbage, and balanced feed to be able to raise more chickens. She will thereby improve her profitability in order to gradually improve the quality of life for her and her son, for whom she wants a better future.",
