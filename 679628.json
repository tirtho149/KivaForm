                "description": "Gadafi is 24 years old and is single. He owns a retail shop in Mutukula, which he started in 2006, and works for 7 hours every day.\r\n\r\nHe also does both crop farming and cattle keeping, which he started in order to supplement his income and due to the fact that he had experience in farming. He usually supplies his goods to fellow retailers and local people around Mutukula. \r\n\r\nGadafi hopes to use the loan to stock more goods for the shop and to buy produce for his farm. He faces a challenge of inadequate capital and also price fluctuations plus the high taxes charged on the goods across the border. \r\n\r\nGadafi is described as a hard working and honest man and appreciates the work done by Ugafode micro finance limited.\r\n\r\n",
