                "description": "Ahmed is a 19 years old single young man who lives with his family in a small house in Hodeida governorate. He just finished secondary school last year.\n\nAhmed is a hardworking young man who works as a motorcyclist. The current situation in Yemen has forced him to  work on the motorcycle to be able to help  his father in covering the needs of his family and not complete his higher education. One of the current essential needs of his family is purchasing a solar power system to compensate the absence of public electricity due to the ongoing conflict in Yemen that started before more than two years. Since Ahmed can afford purchasing such power system, he has applied for an interest-free loan from Al-Amal Microfinance  Bank in the amount of 63,000 YER to purchase a 150W solar panel, a 100Amp battery and cables.\n\nAhmed is looking forwards to continuing his higher education after the end of this conflict.",
