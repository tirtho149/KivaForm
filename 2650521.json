Her business is growing and allows her to generate work for her family members. <br /><br />Support for this loan will allow her to acquire sprouted cacao seed, substrate, fertilizers, disinfectants, and polyethylene bags. <br /><br />This will help her to germinate more cacao seedlings in order to sell inside and outside the province, managing to have better sales that will return the profits necessary to generate economic stability, allowing her to improve her living conditions.",
