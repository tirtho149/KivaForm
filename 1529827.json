He is 50 years old, married, and has 2 children.<br /><br />Patrick likes to think of himself as a very friendly person. He has been working alongside One Acre Fund since 2013, and decided to represent his group because he wanted to help more farmers. He says that being part of the One Acre Fund community has meant that he has been able to consistently feed his family. <br /><br />Patrick plans to use the profits from this coming season to rent more land to cultivate.<br /><br />In total, Patrick’s Group will receive inputs to cultivate 9.25 acres of land. Given that some members of the group will also be purchasing a solar light with this loan, the group will also receive a total of three solar lights.",
