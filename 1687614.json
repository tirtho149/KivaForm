                "description": "Jackline is 29 years old and has four children. She is a group leader, and is representing her group formed by 13 farmers in Kimilili district, Kenya. <br /><br />Jackline has been farming with One Acre Fund for years now, having joined the program for the first time in 2013. This decision was largely a result of her desire to get the best quality fertilizer and hybrid seeds and, although she described her last harvest as good, she believes she could have a better one this year by continuing to work alongside One Acre Fund. <br /><br />ackline also decided to purchase a solar light as part of her loan, which she is very excited about, as it will allow her to reduce the consumption of paraffin fuel and therefore save more money.<br /><br />Obtaining this loan means that Jackline's Group will be able to receive a total of seven solar lights, as well as farming inputs to plant a total of 5.75 acres.",
