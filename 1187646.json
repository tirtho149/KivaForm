                "description": "Pictured above is Eunice, who, as a group leader, is representing her group formed by 12 farmers in Webuye District, Kenya. She is married and is a mother to 4 children. She is known by her community as a very hardworking individual.<br /><br />Initially, Eunice joined One Acre Fund in 2009 because she wanted to earn enough to feed her family. Since she joined the program she says that her life has improved, especially because she has had a healthier life due to better nutrition. With the profits from the coming harvesting season, Eunice plans to send her children to school.<br /><br />Between the 12 farmers in Eunice's Group, a total of 5.75 acres of land will be planted using the maize seeds and fertilizer received with the loan. Additionally, some of the farmers in the group will be purchasing a solar light so, with this loan, the group will also receive a total of 3 solar lights.",
