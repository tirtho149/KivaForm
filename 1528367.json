He is a father to 10 children and is known by his community as a very friendly person.<br /><br />Initially, Wyclif joined One Acre Fund in 2009 because he wanted to earn enough to feed his family. Since he joined the program, he says that his life has improved, especially because he has been able to consistently feed his family. With the profits from the coming harvesting season, Wyclif plans to invest in a business.<br /><br />Between the 15 farmers in Wyclif's Group, a total of 9.25 acres of land will be planted using the maize seeds and fertilizer received with the loan. Additionally, some of the farmers in the group will be purchasing a solar light, so the group will also receive a total of three solar lights with this loan.",
