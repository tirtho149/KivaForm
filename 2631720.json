He received one-and-a-half hectares of land as a gift from his father when he turned 18. He currently cultivates over 6,000 coffee plants and 150 plantain trees. Aureliano produces his own fertilizers, nurturing his crops for optimal growth with techniques inherited from his family.<br /><br />Aureliano lives with his supportive wife and two children in a house they purchased together. His children attend the local school and the whole family works hand in hand to maintain their crops.<br /><br />Aureliano is requesting a humble loan of $1,150,401 COP to buy various agricultural supplies including compost and fertilizers that will optimize the productivity of his crops. This investment will enable him to achieve higher yields, secure his family's future, and contribute to the community's well-being.",
