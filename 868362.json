Zisa has been doing agriculture for the past ten years. Currently, he has apple orchards as seen in the photograph and also plants in large quantities tomatoes, wheat and fodder. He then sells the fresh and organic products to wholesale buyers. \r\n\r\nAgriculture has been the only source of income for Zisa’s family all these past years; his plans are to grow it to a larger farm by renting from other villagers and adding some more orchards including cherries and pears, considering the fact that the soil and weather support such trees, according to him.
