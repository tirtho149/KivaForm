                "description": "Lydia (38), wears a beautiful smile. When she began farming, Lydia had a clear mindset of what she wanted to achieve: to turn around her life and to give her family a better life. She promised herself that she would sacrifice her time and energy for her family’s sake.<br /><br />After deriving profit from her first harvest, Lydia felt uplifted and encouraged to invest more in agribusiness. Today, she is an established dairy and crop farmer living in Eldoret, a land of seemingly never-ending beauty. She values education, and this explains why she has promised to educate all her children until they pursue degree courses. Her major challenge in achieving her dream is reduced crop productivity.<br /><br />In the modern world, agriculture has become exceedingly dynamic, making the kind of inputs that are being used in the sector today upgraded. On this note, there is a need to use improved farming inputs for effective production.<br /><br />Lydia is seeking a loan of KES 100,000 to buy farm inputs such as high-quality seeds and fertilizer to improve productivity on her farm. With the loan, she will be on her way to a bumper harvest, and this will translate to more profit and cash. Kindly lend to make her second half of 2021 great.",
