As a group leader, he represents his group of seven farmers in Alego District, Kenya. <br /><br />James is returning this season to work with One Acre Fund again, as this enables him to have access to quality training and acquire new farming methods which is why he decided to join in the first place. James says that he is happy to have made that decision because, since he first joined in 2016, he has been able to consistently feed his family, which has improved his day-to-day life significantly.<br /><br />James will use the profits from this season to save more money for the future.<br /><br />His group will use this loan to purchase seeds and fertilizer to plant a total of 6.25 acres.",
