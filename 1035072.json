                "description": "Elika is 67 years old and has seven children. She is a group leader and is representing her group formed by 14 farmers in Webuye District, Kenya. <br /><br />Elika has been farming with One Acre Fund for years now, having joined the program for the first time in 2011. This decision was largely a result of her desire to have access to quality training and acquire new farming methods and, although she described her last harvest as good, she believes she could have a better one this year by continuing to work alongside One Acre Fund. Elika also decided to purchase a solar light as part of her loan, which she is very excited about, as it will allow her to reduce the consumption of paraffin fuel and therefore save more money.<br /><br />Obtaining this loan means that Elika's Group will be able to receive a total of seven solar lights, as well as farming inputs to plant a total of 5.25 acres.",
