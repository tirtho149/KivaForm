                "description": "Mr. Amnuay is a small-scale organic rice farmer in the Northeastern part of Thailand. He is 46 years old, and he has two children. Both of his children are studying in high school. <br /><br />He turned to organic rice farming 16 years ago with 3.5-acres of farmland. He does organic rice farming along with raising a small number of livestock that includes oxen and pigs. He makes use of their waste to create natural fertilizer for organic rice farming. <br /><br />Mr. Amnuay is requesting a loan to purchase cows. He expects this financial assistance will allow him to improve the quality of soil on his farmland and help raise his rice yield by 10 percent compared to last season. <br /><br />With the increased income this will bring, he plans to build a livestock farm. He hopes that working as an organic farmer will be a career option for his two children after their graduation.",
