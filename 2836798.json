Coffee farmers are continuously searching and innovating to decrease production costs, buy at the same time ensure the best coffee quality production. <br /><br />Lily saw that her neighbors installed a Sistema.bio digester in their farms and she saw how the biodigester was making amazing changes in their crops. The cows' manure was transformed into a very potent and organic fertilizer and biogas (clean and renewable energy) through the biodigester. <br /><br />Lily wants to buy her own biodigester to reduce her reliance on expensive and non-renewable agrochemical fertilizers to increase the quality of her vegetables, processing the manure from her cows, helping both her wallet and the environment.<br /><br />This loan represents 100% of the price of the biodigester.",
