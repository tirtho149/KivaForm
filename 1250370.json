                "description": "The Mabinti Grannies are an exceptional group of unemployed older women who have been life-long traders in Makoth and have children and grandchildren in the town. Like leader Mabinti K (third picture), all lost their trading businesses during the Country's recent Ebola Crisis and many lost family members as the town of Makoth was hard hit by the disease. While international coverage of the outbreak and acute danger have faded, the stark economic damage done is still creating enormous challenges for survivors and this group's experience is sadly not unique. All respected elders in the community, the Mabinti Grannies have demonstrated business skills and know the trading business well. A KIVA loan will enable this exceptional, hard-working group of women to get back on their feet and back to business. \n\nThe Mabinti Grannies are committed to buying locally produced, rather than imported, rice to support local farmers. The group’s KIVA loan will therefore be used to purchase organic, locally produced rice which will increase employment and food access in Makoth. ",
