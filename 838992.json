She has been running a business of growing and selling vegetables for three years now.  She works from 7 AM to 4 PM daily and is able to make a very good monthly profit.\r\n\r\nThis will be Restuta's second loan from Tujijenge Tanzania.

She dreams of taking her kids to good schools.\r\n\r\nRestuta will share this loan with her loan group \"Hondogo Kibamba\" which has three members who will hold each other accountable for paying back the loan.\r\n",
