She is a 25-year-old refugee and a mother of three kids, living with her family in Tulkarem, West Bank. Her husband is the sole provider for the family; he works in farming with a seasonal income. <br /><br />Marah wants to help her husband through work by selling agricultural seedlings in order to enhance her family's income. She turned to Palestine for Credit and Development (FATEN) to request a loan to buy tools and supplies needed for her work. This will improve the family's living standards. She hopes you will help by funding her loan. <br /><br />Marah is a conservative woman; for that reason, her husband appears in the photo.",
