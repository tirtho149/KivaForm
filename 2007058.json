                "description": "Noel is 31 years old and has a son. He's a farmer (coffee and basic grains). From a young age, he's worked in agriculture. He owns a small piece of land where he sows coffee and basic grains. He currently has a modest wooden home where he lives with his wife and son.<br /><br />On the days that he isn't working on his own crops, he's working as a day worker and earning wages to feed his family. He dreams of building his house with cement, which he can accomplish by working hard and cultivating more coffee plants, since it was with his own efforts that he was able to prepare his own seedling bed to grow more coffee. All this so that in the future, his family can live the life they deserve.<br /><br />He's requesting a Kiva Loan from Fundenuse to buy manure and foliar fertilizer to provide maintenance for his corn and coffee crops. This will help him greatly reduce the incidence of plagues and possibly get a good yield.<br /><br />He's part of the group “Los Guerreros” (The Warriors) along with Cesar, Edgard, José and Kenner who are all farmers.",
